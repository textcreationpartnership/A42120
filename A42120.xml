            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O Man, I think, who shall consider the Allegorical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which some, especially of the Fathers, have given us upon several Parts of Scripture, and even St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our also upon divers of his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, but will say, I have been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in the Doctrinal Inferences made from the Parable here before us.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but that as a
<pb facs="tcp:94446:3"/>wise man may have more Reasons than One for what he saith, so may he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to teach more than one thing, or sort of persons thereby: How much more reasonable is it then, that we allow the same to that infinite Wisdome, by which our Blessed Saviour always spake? Not only directing his Words to the Generation then in being, but also inspiring his Apostles to transmit them in writing to all Posterity. So that as they had their. Lessons to learn then, so have we ours now, from the self same words, so far as our Case may any way bear a proportion unto theirs. For it is not intelligible, to what end they should be left us in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if we were not concerned to learn something of Importance from them, as well as they.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94446:3"/>
            <p>Something, I say, and that from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Word or Clause, so far, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any vain and affected straining may be soberly inferr'd, and the truth thereof confirm'd by other parts of Scripture. For it were highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to our Saviour, to think, That he, who was so much against <hi>Battologies</hi> in his Disciples, should himself have the Vanity, or be forced, for want of skill, to use any words only to fill up Vacuities in his Discourse. So that, although nothing should be strained, yet is there not a Clause in this whole Parable, which affords not some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and important Instruction. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise our Saviour could very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, and would much rather have left it out.</p>
            <p>From the consideration of what hath been said, it seemeth plain, That this
<pb facs="tcp:94446:4"/>first part of the Parable of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal pointeth not only to the Scribes and Pharisees, but to every uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted man, whose Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are herein clearly and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented; as one that is wilfull and heady, blind and desperately bent upon his Lusts, against the will of God, to the wounding, and greatest danger of undoing his own Soul. In a word, shewing him to be nothing else but <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogus inversus,</hi> the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments turned upside down. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of fall'n Man being greater than even that of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when from a mighty Monarch, he fell into a kind of Brutality, and was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to graze with the Beasts of the field. What saith the Spirit of God himself? <hi>Psal. 49.20. Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the Beasts that perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94446:4"/>
            <p>Nor doth this Character belong only to the Vicious and Debauched, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wisest and most Civilliz'd of Men, who do not what they do in a sound Faith of God Almighty's Word, a sincere Obedience to his Law, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the help of his Holy Spirit, out of Love and Design for his Glory, and that through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Jesus Christ they may be happy in the enjoyment of him in the end. Far greater Things than the most accomplished Morality (as we take the word from the Latines, and they their Notions hereof from the Greeks) could ever pretend unto. So far, that I shall not do so great a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Christian Religion, as to make it a Question, by going about to prove it.</p>
            <p>That wise man <hi>Cato,</hi> who was called
<pb facs="tcp:94446:5"/>
               <hi>Homo Virtuti similllimus,</hi> the very Picture of Virtue; yet (in the fourth Book of his Morals) scoffed at God's Institutions in the Ceremonial Law, which prefigured the death of our Lord Jesus Christ for lost Sinners.
<q>Stultitia est, morte alterius sperare salutem.</q> And <hi>Plato,</hi> though styled <hi>Divine,</hi> yet did rather dream of God than know him distinctly, as was the judgment of <hi>Lactantius</hi> concerning him; <hi>Lib. de vanitate Philosophiae &amp; Philosopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however it may be to us a secret, what God, the Sovereign Lord of all, may do with any persons from amongst the Jews, and before the Gospel; yet as for those to whom it hath been
<pb facs="tcp:94446:5"/>preached, we are sure, <hi>That without Faith it is impossible to please God:</hi> And, <hi>that he that believeth not,</hi> so doth not all those things that are the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of a Gospel Faith, <hi>shall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me therefore conclude with this Exhortation to every Reader: First try your self by this Standard, whether you are weight, by the Character here before you, whether you be included in it, and that it expresseth your own heart, yea or no. If it doth, then be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of your self, and tremble at the Condition you are in. If it doth not, then have compassion on those whom it doth include: And to Compassion add, you cannot choose but add, your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and to both your best and prudent endeavours to reclaim them; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, amongst many other encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:94446:6"/>that great one which the Apostle <hi>James</hi> mentions, viz. <hi>That he who converts a sinner from the errour of his way, shall save a Soul, and hide a a multitude of sins.</hi> And that this may be the blessed fruit, as of the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatise, so of all other means to be used in order thereunto, is the most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Prayer of the Authour</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is one of the three remarkable Parables spoken by our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this Chapter, the lost Sheep, the lost piece of Silver, and the lost Son, all three having one and the same Scope, <hi>viz.</hi> To shew the care of God in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94446:10"/>lost Sinners, and the comfort he takes in finding them; or his great readiness to receive a returning Sinner.</p>
               <p>Now the reason why Christ used Parables so much in his preaching, was in general, That the Scripture might be fulfilled: <hi>All these things spake Jesus unto the Multitude in Parables, and without a Parable spake he not unto them: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my mouth in Parables, I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world, Matth.</hi> 13.34, 35. And more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did it in mercy to some;
<note place="margin">Psal. 78.2.</note>
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 4.33. <hi>And with many such Parables spake he the Word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</hi> And to others in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Luke</hi> 8.10. —<hi>but to others in Parables; that seeing, they might not see; and hearing, they might not understand.</hi> For Parables are sometimes called in Scripture <hi>Dark sayings;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 78.2.</note>
                  <hi>I will incline mine ear to a Parable, I will open my dark saying upon the Harp, Psal.</hi> 49.4. So said the Disciples of them, <hi>John</hi> 16.29. <hi>Now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no Proverb, or Parable.</hi> A Parable is like a Candle in a dark Lanthorn, there is light within, but darkness without. Indeed Parables are the extracts and spirits of Wisdom, and have usually come from the mouths of Rulers, or other wise men: Solomon <hi>spake three thousand</hi> Parables,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 4.32.</note> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs.</hi> Nor is <hi>a Parable becoming the mouth of a Fool, Prov.</hi> 26.7.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Hebrew <hi>Mashal,</hi> which signifieth to speak Parabolically, signifies also to bear Rule or Dominion: For Parables have influence upon all the Faculties of man, upon the Understanding, <hi>Joh.</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94446:10"/>3.12. They help the Memory, as a Thread keeps together loose Beads. They quicken the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Where had this man this wisdom?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13.54.</note> said they of Jesus, when he had spoken so many Parables:
<note place="margin">Luke 4.22.</note> and <hi>they wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> Yea, Parables have power on the Conscience; so had <hi>Nathan</hi>'s on <hi>David</hi>'s, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Yet I must commend this Rule to you in all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables; you must not be over-curious to set in a frame, as it were, every thing or word in a Parable, lest you spoil the Analogy. For in Parables some Phrases are used for the decorum of them, as fitting Colours in a Mapp or Picture, that are not of the Essence of it, but for Ornament. And this we see in Christ's expounding of his own Parables; in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he gives only the scope and main drift of them: which, if well considered, might have saved the Schoolmen the labour of their vain Curiosities and Disputes about them. In a word, Parables are Similitudes fetched from Earthly things which are in common use, to help the Understanding in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly things. So to parabolize in the Hebrew and Greek, signifies to liken or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare.</p>
               <p>Now for the occasion of this and the other two Parables in this Chapter, we have it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; <hi>There drew near unto him all the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Scribes to hear him:</hi> And the Scribes and Pharisees murmured, saying, <hi>This man receiveth sinners, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon he spake this Parable to them, saying, <hi>What man of you having one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the Wilderness, and go after
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94446:11"/>that which is lost, till he find it? and when he hath found it, he lays it on his shoulders rejoycing.</hi> Here our Lord Jesus shews these men their Errour, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at his conversing with those Heathen men, by shewing God's care and readiness for, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the conversion of lost sinners. And Christ enlarges himself on this Subject by three Parables. And why so many to the same purpose? Surely to convince the murmuring Scribes and Pharisees, and to encourage the poor Publicans and Sinners that were now in the way of Conversion.</p>
               <p>Yet there is one thing of observation as to these three Parables, and that is the difference that seems to be in this last of the lost Son, and those of the lost Sheep and lost piece of Silver. The lost Sheep is sought for by the Shepheard, and the lost piece of Silver is sought by the Woman; but the lost Son seems to seek his Father: and so it may seem to shew, How a lost Sinner first seeketh God, and is first in motion to Conversion.</p>
               <p>But no such matter, nor is it here meant. In the two first Parables the contrary is plain, That God is first in seeking lost Sinners: As in the Prophet, <hi>I am sought of them that asked not for me;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 65.2.</note>
                  <hi>I am found of them that sought me not.</hi> The words sound somewhat harsh for want of the word [now], which must be understood, I am now found of them that sought me not—I am now sought of them that asked not for me. The Apostle quoting this place of the Prophet saith thus,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.2.</note>
                  <hi>I was found of them that sought me not: I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.</hi> The expressions are like those in <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 65.24.</note>
                  <hi>Before they call, I will answer.</hi> Both hold out the preventive Mercy and Grace of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94446:11"/>God; he is first in the Call and Conversion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The Jews were <hi>in their blood,</hi> when the Lord called them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. and the Gentiles doting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Idols. <hi>Jerusalem was a City sought out, Isa.</hi> 62.12. and Christ was the Seeker;
<note place="margin">Luke 19.10.</note>
                  <hi>The Son of man is come to seek, and to save that which was lost.</hi> Yea, God and Christ, Father and Son, seek and beseech the Sinner; <hi>As though God did beseech you by us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.2.</note>
                  <hi>we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where is that converted Sinner, that can or dare say, that he was before God in the work?
<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.6.</note>
                  <hi>When I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, live.</hi> As the Eye-lids in the Looking-glass move not, but as the Eyes that look into the Glass move: so is it in a Sinner's Conversion to God; God is the first mover and the first worker; the Sinner's Motion is but the reflection of Gods. Who did strike the first stroke in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conversion?
<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> He that struck him to the Earth, which was the Lord.
<note place="margin">John 11.</note>
                  <hi>Lizarus</hi> rose up, and came forth of the Grave, but it was at Christ's loud Call; that is, by his Power.</p>
               <p>As therefore the two former Parables in their phrases shew, That God first seeks a lost Sinner; so this third, of the lost Son, imports, That a Sinner must seek God; he must seek, though he be not first in seeking: <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, Isa.</hi> 55.6, 7. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord.</hi> There are some things for a man to do about his Conversion, but nothing in it; that is God's work.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94446:12"/>
               <p>Yet man hath ever made a great strife and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between his Will and God's.
<note place="margin">Note.</note> This was the reason of the fall of man: and ever since there hath been overmuch ascribed to the power of man's Will; as though little of it were lost by the fall. This hath been the pride of some men in most Ages, supposing man's Will to have lost little of its strength; as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> thought, when he wakened after his Locks were cut off;
<note place="margin">Judges 16.</note>
                  <hi>I will go out as at other times before;</hi> not knowing that his strength was departed. But God hath still kept up Instruments,
<note place="margin">Aug.</note> to lay down these Mole-hills; not wronging Nature, but righting Grace; and causing men to cry Grace, Grace, to a Sinners Conversion, as they did to the Head-stone of the Temple, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Now of this Parable there are three parts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though the Similitude be of outward things, yet there is a Spiritual meaning, which we must search out: We must break the Bone for the Marrow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained; and the Marrow lies in these three things, or particulars, taught us in the three parts of the Parable.</p>
               <p>We have a Description of the state of a lost Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and what manner of man he is in his Natural Condition; In the younger Son's requiring his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Father, and going from his Father's House into a farr Country, and misspending it all there, and making any sorry shift rather than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to his Father's House, <hi>to the</hi> 17th <hi>verse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have the Return of a lost Sinner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and how he comes into the state of Grace, described in the Prodigal's coming to himself, and coming back, and humbling himself to his Father, <hi>to the</hi> 22th <hi>verse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The willingness of God to receive returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94446:12"/>and the delight he takes in such, shewed in the Father's meeting his returning Son, and the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful entertainment he gave him, <hi>from the</hi> 22th <hi>verse to the end of the Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the first of these three Persons is God the Father; he is intended: The other two are Sons of God; the one a humble repenting Publican, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a proud murmuring Pharisee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how can these be called the Sons of God?</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. Job 1.6.</note> but he hath Sons by Creation; so Angels are the Sons of God: <hi>There was a day, when the Sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord.</hi> And all men are the Sons of God: <hi>He breathed into man the breath of life, Gen.</hi> 2.7. Man's Spirit is immediately from God, and therefore he is called <hi>the Father of Spirits.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.9. Luke 3. ult.</note> And <hi>Adam</hi> is called <hi>the Son of God: which was the Son of</hi> Seth, <hi>which was the Son of</hi> Adam, <hi>which was the Son of God.</hi> And thus these Publicans and Sinners were the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>And there are Sons of God by Profession; so were the Jews in opposition to the Gentiles: <hi>When Israel was a Child, then I loved him, and called my Son out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.1. And thus the Scribes and Pharisees were the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>It's true, there are divers Opinions of these two Sons, whom they should represent. Some make the Angels the elder Son, and Man the younger; but this cannot be: For the Angels murmur not at the tenderness of God to lost Man, as here the elder Son does, but rejoyce at it, <hi>verse</hi> 7, 10. <hi>of this Chapter, and</hi> 14th <hi>of the second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others think a Regenerate and Unregenerate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94446:13"/>man are here personated: But neither can this be; because Regenerate men do not grudge at God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the greatest sinners into Grace and Favour, but are glad, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. There are other thoughts in the Case besides these.</p>
               <p>But the most rational and most appearing Sense and Interpretation is, That by the elder Son is meant the Scribes and Pharisees, and by the younger the Publicans and Sinners; for to these, and of these Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was now speaking. And as the elder Son grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that his Father so entertained his Prodigal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that had spent all upon Harlots, <hi>verse</hi> 30. so the Pharisees and Scribes murmured that Jesus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Sinners, and did eat with them, <hi>verse</hi> 2. And this sense is held out by Christ himself in another Parable of two Sons:
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.28, 31.</note>
                  <hi>Verily I say unto you</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Priests) <hi>that the Publicans and the Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you.</hi> Self-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners sooner get into a state of Grace than Self-justiciaries.
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.30, 31. &amp; 10.3.</note> The greatest Sinners sooner come unto Christ, than self-conceited Moralists; Self-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness keeps men off from Christ: Such men set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on their own bottoms.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving shewed you the general import and parts of the Parable, I come now to the consideration of those several points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein contained. And first of that which seems to be the most conspicuous Doctrine from the whole Parable. Afterwards of those in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which result from the several Parts. The first I shall lay down, and illustrate in this Chapter; and it is this,
<note place="margin">The general Doctrine from the Parable. 2 Sam. 13.</note> That God doth very graciously receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning sinners. You know the History of <hi>David</hi>'s carriage to <hi>Absolom</hi> after he had murthered his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>David</hi> was highly displeased with <hi>Absolom,</hi> so that he was forced out of his Fathers presence three years; yet after it is said, <hi>That the soul of King</hi> David <hi>longed to go forth unto</hi> Absolom. And when <hi>Absolom</hi> afterwards came into his presence, and bowed himself before the King, it's said, <hi>The King kissed</hi> Absolom, Chap. 14.</p>
               <p>Alas, this is nothing to the bowels of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a self-bemoaning sinner:
<note place="margin">Jer. 32.18, 19, 20.</note>
                  <hi>I have surely heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himself, therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94446:14"/>
               <p>God is irreconcilable to sinning Angels;
<note place="margin">Note.</note> he hath cast them down to Hell, and <hi>delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto Judgment,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.4. but he sues to sinning men for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.2.</note>
                  <hi>As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> You know what mourning words he put into <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s mouth;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note>
                  <hi>Say to the house of</hi> Israel, <hi>who say, If our transgressions and sins be upon us, and we pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live saith the Lord God, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O house of</hi> Israel? No man can be so serious in any Case, as God is in this; in his desires that sinners should repent, and return and live.</p>
               <p>There are some things that the Devil frequently gets into the thoughts of awakened sinners to dash them in this case.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One is the thought of God's Decrees; but herein the Devil doth grosly abuse both God and the sinner: For let me tell you, That as the Decrees of God did not at all clash with mans power given him in Innocency, to have been happy for ever, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they clash with God's affectionate inviting lost sinners to return to him since the fall, no more than his Prescience would do if there were no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: Fore events are as sure upon God's Prescience as upon his Decrees: And this made <hi>Socinus</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Prescience of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as the Decree was no cause at all of mans fall, but his own Will, he would hearken to the Woman, and to the Serpent, rather than to God,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94446:14"/>and would eat; so God's Decree is no cause at all of man's damnation: The Decree of God damns no man, but his own Will:
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note>
                  <hi>Why will ye die O house of</hi> Israel? I would, and ye would not.
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.37.</note>
                  <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 5.40. Luke 19.14.</note>
                  <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> God's Decree of Reprobation, as it's called, does only, for ought appears to me, leave some men to be proceeded with in a way of Justice. And assuredly mens dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will be found to be of themselves: <hi>O</hi> Israel, <hi>Thou hast destroyed thy self.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 13.9.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.
<note place="margin">Note.</note> God's Decree is not the first thing that a sinner is to consider in his returning unto God, but God's Call, and Christ's Invitation.
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note> These are the first things which the sinner is to mind; <hi>Why will ye die? Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 6.37.</note>
                  <hi>and I will give you rest: and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mens election is not a ground for their returning to God;
<note place="margin">Note.</note> but their return to God is a proof of their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It's true, Election is the first in order in God's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, but Conversion is the first in order of ours: we must be Called before we can know that we are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. O remember this, that a sinners busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that he is put upon in the Scriptures, is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, and to believe in Christ: This is his Call.</p>
               <p>But then here the Tempter pusles again, and bids thee reason thus: If I knew that Christ died for me, I say for me, then I could set my self to believe, and that in hope. Poor Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> look upon this as a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation also; and consider this well, That the Scripture hath given thee as much assurance, that Christ died for thee, as any sinner else that doth not yet believe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94446:15"/>or as to any believer before he did believe: Thou knowest as much of Christ's dying for thee, as any Saint in the world did before he did believe in Christ.</p>
               <p>And again, why not Christ die for thee? because thou art a sinner? Why, he died for such: wert thou not a sinner, thou wouldest have no need of Christ;
<note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note>
                  <hi>The whole need not the Physician.</hi> Christ had not died, if thou and I had not been sinners. Or is thy doubt whether Christ died for thee, because thou art so great a sinner? consider what <hi>Paul</hi> says in his own case,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.15.</note>
                  <hi>Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Many of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sort of sinners were called by Christ when he was on earth,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21. John 4.</note> Publicans and Harlots; that woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> that was an Idolater and an Harlot; and that notorious woman called a sinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. You cannot be ignorant how many Instances of this nature there are in Scripture;
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.14.</note>
                  <hi>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious, but I obtained mercy.</hi> So that well may the Scripture say, <hi>The grace of our Lord is exceeding abundant;</hi> hath abounded to flowing over:
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note> And <hi>where sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, grace did much more abound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The matter is not what a sinner thou hast been, or art; but how thou standest affected to thy sinful state, and how thy mind stands towards a better. If thou beest so far come to thy self, as to be upon thoughts of returning to God, as it's said of this Prodigal afterwards, now take heed of the Devil's Sophistry; now he will be pusling thee with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful disputations and reasonings, to hinder the main work, <hi>viz.</hi> the bewailing thy sinful state, and thy self in it, and looking out for relief.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94446:15"/>
               <p>But I shall further clear this Point by several ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servables in the Parable; and indeed, amongst all the Parables of Christ, this is the fullest of affections, and set forth in the liveliest colours to humbled sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and you shall see it in six Particulars.</p>
               <p>First, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you may observe how God exceeds the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning sinner in affections: here the old Father sees his Son a great way off; his eyes were not dim, as <hi>Isaac</hi>'s were, who could not by his sight distinguish between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> though close by him. God can distinguish betwixt serious Penitents and feignedly turning <hi>Judah, Jer.</hi> 3.10. <hi>He knows what is in man, John</hi> 2.25.</p>
               <p>And then he ran to meet his Son; he stood not still as a Father, an offended Father might have done, till his offending Son came to him: No, his bowels were moved towards him, as towards <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, Jer.</hi> 31.20. Yea observe, the Son only goes to his Father, but the Father runs to meet the Son. There are greater affections in God towards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting sinner, than in such a sinner towards God; God out-does him in affections.</p>
               <p>And then, when they meet, the Father does not take him by the hand, which had been much for a displeased Father, but falls on his neck and kisses him, as <hi>Joseph</hi> did on his Brethrens that had sold him into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O the riches of mercy in God towards repenting and returning sinners!
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.3.</note> to such he becomes the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies,</hi> begetting mercy after mercy for them. Yea, once more observe, That though the repenting Prodigal Son said in himself, <hi>I will go unto my Father, and say, Father, I have sinned</hi>— yet he did it not, till his Father had fallen on his neck
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94446:16"/>and embraced him. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> The kindliest repentings for sins are after the sinners sense and experience of the free mercy and grace of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> you shall observe in the Parable, how God doth graciously take notice of small beginnings of Grace in a true Convert; he excepts of sparks before they flame; he despiseth not the day of small things in a seriously returning sinner: when this Prodigal came to himself, and but said, <hi>I will arise, and go to my Father;</hi> though yet a great way off God saw him, and went towards him.</p>
               <p>When poor sinners begin to set their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, he is much pleased with it; he notes their secret sighings and hidden groanings. When the heart begins to melt, he makes much of such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings; <hi>he will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoaking flax, Isa.</hi> 42.3. A Hen will give over sitting a rotten Egg, but while there is life in it she will not leave it: Why so God will at length cast off unsound hearts, feignedly turning sinners, as they are called <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. albeit he take some present notice of their external humblings, as of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. but if the heart of a sinner be broken indeed, and indeed pointing to God, now he regards the offers of such a sinner; he will strengthen the bruised reed, and not break it; and he will blow up the sparks of smoaking flax, and not put them out. O the riches of Grace, of the grace of God, who before we come to act, accepts of secret and serious purposes! <hi>I said,</hi> saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I will confess my transgression to the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquities of my sin, Psal.</hi> 32.5. God's ear was at <hi>David</hi>'s heart, before <hi>David</hi>'s Confession could be in his mouth; like that in <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94446:16"/>68.24. <hi>Before they call I will answer</hi>—</p>
               <p>God takes notice of the preparations and first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart towards himself;
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 6.8.</note>
                  <hi>Because it was in thine heart to build me an house, thou didst well; forasmuch as it was in thine heart.</hi> God's gracious and tender dealing with a sinner upon his first setting out towards him, is very observable.</p>
               <p>But here the lazy sinner must not think to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate his dull acknowledgments of his sins, and to get acceptance with God at his cold <hi>Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me;</hi> as if God would be found of such as these. He accepts of the Prodigal's thoughts and resolves of returning, because he saw he was restless in himself, till he was returned; <hi>but the sluggard desireth and hath nothing,</hi> Prov. 13.4. God respects not the sparks of a slint, though he make much of those of smoaking flax. The cold forced Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hard hearted <hi>Pharaoh, I have sinned this time, Exod.</hi> 9. was not much to God: God rejects the humblings of a customary sinner, <hi>that afflicts his soul only for a day, Isa.</hi> 58.5. such Penitents may expect much from God, <hi>v.</hi> 3. but God regards them little.</p>
               <p>Jesus Christ was sent by his Father <hi>to bind up the broken hearted, Isa.</hi> 61.1. The outwardly flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hypocrite and proud Justiciary may spread forth their hands, yet God will hide his eyes from them; <hi>and though they make many prayers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 1.15.</note> God will not hear: But for poor souls that are serious in setting their faces towards God, and wait humbly on free grace; God will answer them before they call, and hear before they ask; that is, his mercy and grace shall prevent them: He observes the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motions of their hearts with content: God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94446:17"/>takes notice of small beginnings of grace in a true Convert.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God mercifully remits the remembrance of the former sins of a converting sinner. The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother of this Prodigal upbraids him with his former loose life, but his Father does not mention it to him. The Silences of Scripture are Instructing; the Holy Ghost remembers us of <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience,
<note place="margin">James 5.11.</note> but speaks not a word of his Passions.</p>
               <p>Take notice of it, thou poor relenting sinner; though the proud Pharisees of the world may throw thy former vileness, as dirt, in thy face, when thou art returning to God, yet God will not do so: <hi>If the wicked turn from all his sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.21.</note>
                  <hi>his sins shall not be mentioned to him.</hi> A strange thing! he that remembers every thing, will forget such a mans sins.</p>
               <p>Indeed you must not forget them, though God will;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.11.</note> no, not when they are forgiven: <hi>You shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and be confounded — when I am pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward you.</hi> Yet God will not upbraid you with them, though you do your selves.</p>
               <p>It is certain that God does, and will remember the sins of unhumbled and unchanged sinners; he hath sworn he will, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.7. <hi>The Lord hath sworn by the excellency of</hi> Jacob,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.2.</note>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> himself; <hi>surely I will never forget any of their works. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what</hi> Amalek <hi>did to</hi> Israel. This was four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years since:
<note place="margin">Psal. 8.13.</note>
                  <hi>Now will he remember their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> But to Souls humbled for sin, <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> Isa. 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that will not remember thy sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94446:17"/>
               <p>Fourthly, as God will graciously remit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of former sins to a returning sinner,
<note place="margin">Zach. 3.</note> and so <hi>cause his iniquity to pass away;</hi> so he <hi>takes away his filthy garments, and clothes him with change of raiment,</hi> v. 22. <hi>The Father said unto his servants, bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.</hi> God will not let the ensigns of a sinner, his filthy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remain on him: when he is humbled for sin, when a sinner is changed, God gives him change of raiment; <hi>I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. <hi>and thy beauty was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect through my comliness put upon thee,</hi> v. 14. These mean the righteousness of Christ imputed, and the graces of his Spirit imparted to a Convert: Christ's righteousness is his upper garment, and humility,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.4. Chap. 5.5.</note> and a meek and quiet spirit, and other graces, are his inward garments. This is another eminent act of grace, which God shews to a returning sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God rejoyceth at the return of a sinner to him; <hi>bring hither the fatted Calf, and kill it,</hi> v. 23. <hi>and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead, and is alive,</hi> v. 24. O what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful condescention is this in God, that he will be merry (to speak with reverence) with a repenting sinner! which is set out by Jesus his eating with Publicans and Sinners, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
               <p>We read <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.17. how God was refreshed with his works of Creation, <hi>he rested on the seventh day, and was refreshed;</hi> and therefore he must needs be refreshed at his new Creature, being a more excellent work than the former. There are more wonders in grace than in nature.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94446:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> was marvellously revived when he heard that <hi>Joseph</hi> was alive, who had been dead many years in his thoughts,
<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note>
                  <hi>It is enough,</hi> Joseph <hi>my son is alive:</hi> Thus saith the Father of the returning Prodigal, Let's be merry, <hi>for this my son was dead, and is alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture also tells us how joyful Jesus Christ is at the sinners conversion, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10, 11. <hi>He shall see his seed, he shall see the travel of his soul and be satisfied. Seest thou this woman,</hi> saith Jesus to <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee <hi>Luke</hi> 7.44. This Woman, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen</hi> (as some think) a great sinner, but a repenting sinner: The words of Christ are glorying words.</p>
               <p>And so the Holy Ghost is contented to speak after the manner of men, as the Scripture doth. I say the Comforter is comforted at the repenting and returning of a sinner to God: as he is grieved and vexed at the unbelief, stubbornness, and obstinacy of sinners, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.10. so is he surely rejoyced at a poor Soul's repenting of sin, and returning from sin to God: and there is reason for it; because a sinners change is the great work of the Spirit; <hi>a man is born again of the spirit,</hi> John 3.</p>
               <p>And further, Angels rejoice at the repentance of sinners, <hi>v.</hi> 10. of this Chapter, <hi>There is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2. Heb. 2.</note> The Angels bear good will to mankind, since Christ took on him the nature of man. The holy Angels have great affection for converted sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.24.</note> They were at a distance from man after the fall, and are still, while men keep at a distance from God; But when a man is come home to God, now the Angels love him, and delight in him, and to do
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94446:18"/>good for him;
<note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note>
                  <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his Tent round about them that fear him, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them.</hi> And <hi>are they not all ministring spirits,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 1.14.</note>
                  <hi>sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And returning sinners themselves have their share in this joy, they take a part in the sweet Consort; the fatted Calf was killed for the returning Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal: It is now that the poor Sinner knows that Christ was his Sacrifice, and that Christ loved him, and gave himself for him.
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> A converted Sinner knows the Spirit of God to be the Comforter, as well as the Sanctifier.</p>
               <p>God begins usually in Converts with great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but ends with great Joy; as a Woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel hath first pain and sorrow, but then <hi>joy that aman is born into the World,</hi> John 16.21, 22. Converted Sinners have commonly at first strong Consolations; for they come into a new World, and into new Company and Acquaintance, such as they never had afore, with God himself, and Jesus Christ, and Saints; and <hi>all things are new to them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. Yet these great Joys are not lasting, though in a state of Grace; the fatted Calf is not killed every day for them, but then especially when the Spirit of Adoption supersedes the Spirit of Bondage. It may be a Case, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> whether <hi>Paul</hi> presently after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version had not greater Joy, than in his taking up into the third Heaven: this occasioned him great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that great joy: O! <hi>I was a blasphemer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note>
                  <hi>and a persecutor, but I obtained mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ and Joy come into the Soul together. When Jesus came in <hi>Maries</hi> womb towards <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> John <hi>leaped for joy in</hi> Elizabeths <hi>womb,</hi> Luke 2.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94446:19"/>Thus you see how the returning Sinner to God is feasted; his water is turned into wine, as at the marriage Feast, <hi>John</hi> 2. There is joy and mirth at Feasts, and the Company at this Feast is such as much enlargeth the joy; not only Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but God himself; <hi>If any man open to me, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me,</hi> Rev. 3.20.</p>
               <p>And therefore certainly, that repentance for sin, that bringeth not forth spiritual joy and comfort, is repentance to be repented of. God puts not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Sinner to sorrow for sorrows sake, but for joy and comfort, to make way for these. God would not have a repenting Sinner lie down in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; but it is the self-confident sinner, or that trusts to lying refuges, who shall do thus, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and lastly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> God justifieth his own actions in receiving and entertaining returning Prodigals so graciously, and with such loving kindness and mercy. The elder Son murmured, and was in a great pett, that his Father had received his Prodigal Brother into his house again, and with love of such remark, <hi>v.</hi> 30. of this Chapter; <hi>As soon as this thy son,</hi> not my brother (he disdained this) <hi>was come, that hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted Calf.</hi> But what saith his Father to him? he justifies what he had done, <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad; for this thy brother was dead, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live again; and was lost, and is found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Chapter we see how the Scribes and Pharisees murmured that Jesus received Sinners, noted Sinners, and eat with them: Now Christ to convince them of their pride, and envy,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94446:19"/>and self-justifying, and self-weening thoughts, and that the Publicans and Sinners, being now in the way of Conversion, was in a better condition than themselves, he spake all these three Parables, which fill up this Chapter.</p>
               <p>God will have men to know, that he hath more kindness for self-judging and self-abasing Sinners, than for self-justifying and self-ascribing righteous men. These think they <hi>need no Repentance,</hi> v. 7. but those think they cannot repent enough. These <hi>trust in themselves that they are righteous,</hi> Luke 18.9. those see nothing but sin in themselves; <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</hi> v. 13. and these were words more than mouth-deep; they came from a sad heart in the deep sense of Sin. Those despise others, <hi>v.</hi> 9. these themselves; <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> Let men say what they will, or think what they will,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens, and that justly. In these mysteries he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not only the common Capacities of the world, but the purest Comprehension of the Saints;
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note>
                  <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I would not have you ignorant of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery;</hi> speaking of the Lord's severe way with the Jews, and gracious and favourable way with the Gentiles. St. <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> the learned,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.2.</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> that was taken up into the third Heaven, and that had abundance of revelations,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.16.</note> and a man of great inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with Christ, yet he is in a maze at these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations, and cries out,
<note place="margin">Rom 11.23.</note>
                  <hi>O the depth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94446:20"/>
               <p>Now from what hath been said on this last Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular we may easily see,
<note place="margin">Note.</note> That it is an ill sign, when Professors of Religion carry it proudly and insulting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over poor Sinners, especially when they begin to look towards Christ. There was a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the carriage of Christ, and of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees and Scribes in this Case: they wonder thus, that Jesus would receive, and eat with Publicans and Sinners that followed him. And <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee, in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. was offended at Jesus, that he would let that woman, which had been noted for a Sinner, touch him; and the like we read of the woman in <hi>John</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Thus you have seen it cleared of all Controversie, That God doth graciously receive repenting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Sinners, how vile soever they have been, by these six Instances in this Parable; 1. God exceeds a returning Sinner in affection. 2. He takes notice of small beginnings of grace in a Convert. 3. He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids not a repenting Sinner with his former sins. 4. He takes away his filthy garments, and gives him change of raiment. 5. There is great joy in Heaven and earth at the conversion of a Sinner. 6. God justifies himself against the censures of men in all this.</p>

                  <hi>Giveth the Reasons of the Doctrine in the foreging Chapter; and the Demonstrations of its unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving thus cleared the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That God doth very graciously receive returning sinners: I shall now proceed to give you the grounds and reasons hereof. And the first</p>
               <p>Is from the Nature of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> which he calls his <hi>Name, Exod.</hi> 33.19. and <hi>his back parts, v.</hi> 19. by which expression he means his Relative Attributes, which are his Attributes that concern us sinners: For God hath two sorts of Attributes; some that describe him what he is in himself, as <hi>I am hath sent thee.</hi> His Infinity, Omnipotency, Eternity, there are his two parts or face, which he calls <hi>his glory;</hi> and so <hi>Moses</hi> called them, <hi>I beseech thee shew me thy glory, v.</hi> 18. and of which the Lord told him, <hi>No man can see my glory and live.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 16.12.</note> No man in the body could bear such a sight, as Christ said to his Disciples in another case.</p>
               <p>And then God hath Relative Attributes, which set him out what he is to us, as poor undone Sinners: these he calls his <hi>back parts;</hi> and these he shewed <hi>Moses,</hi> and made proclamation of them for all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinners to mind for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94446:21"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lord passed by before him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.</note>
                  <hi>and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for thousands, and forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and transgression, and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty:</hi> all but the last are to keep from despair; but that from presumption. All these Attributes but one, are encouraging to all sorts of sinners to repent and return to God, and that one is engaging and enforcing. When <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had heard that the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Kings, they put Sackcloth on their Loins, and Ropes upon their Heads,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 20.</note> and say, <hi>Peradventure the King of Israel will save thy life.</hi> Why, there is no Sinner but hath heard that God is a merciful God to mournful Sinners; and the Sinner heareth not only one word of encouragement come from his mouth, but very many, and every one very inviting to a sinner to come in.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> say there are thirteen Titles in this Name of God, and but one of them vindicative; all the rest alluring to Sinners to repent, and come into God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, Jehovah, Jehovah, Ael.</hi> These three Attributes may import his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Subsistence in three Persons, as in 2 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>Jehovah, Jehovah,</hi> the Lord doubles his Name for <hi>Moses</hi> his better notice, who it was that made this so solemn Proclamation. Jehovah, even Jehovah speaks, as in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake.</hi> And he adds, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God. Ael,</hi> that is, strong and mighty, to make good all that follows in his Name he here proclamed; as <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94446:21"/>says in <hi>Num.</hi> 14.17. <hi>And now I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, &amp;c.</hi> Which shews plainly, that it was God himself that proclam'd his <hi>Name,</hi> and not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> as some have thought.</p>
               <p>And here we may take notice, That to pardon sin is an act of power as well as grace; so saith our Lord Jesus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.6.—<hi>That ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.</hi> It follows,</p>
               <p>Merciful. This is sutable to a Sinners misery; every Sinner being by nature <hi>naked,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note>
                  <hi>and in his blood, and cast out to the loathing of his person; and by nature the child of wrath:</hi> Now <hi>the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note>
                  <hi>the Lord God merciful,</hi> is a word indeed for a Sinner in misery to take hold on, as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Servants did on the word <hi>Brother</hi> from the King of <hi>Israel</hi>'s mouth: Yea, and God is not only merciful, but <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> and he is so for ever;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.3.</note> therefore it is said six and twenty times in one <hi>Psalm</hi> 136. <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gracious. This the Sinner, the convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is to oppose to his own unworthiness;
<note place="margin">Exod. 33.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
                  <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.</hi> A Sinners call would not be of Grace, if there were any thing of worth in him; therefore the objects of God's Call unto grace are commonly <hi>the foolish, and the weak,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note>
                  <hi>and the base, and the despised things of the world: Go and tell</hi> John,
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.5.</note>
                  <hi>that the poor have the Gospel preached to them:</hi> and this was amongst the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that Jesus did, which might convince <hi>John</hi>'s doubting Disciples that he was the Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Long-suffering.</hi> This may answer a repentant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94446:22"/>Sinners fears that arise from his long withstanding the offers of grace;
<note place="margin">Isa. 30.18. Isa. 57.18.</note>
                  <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious. — He went on frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly in the way of his heart; I have seen his ways, and will heal him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 3.1.</note>
                  <hi>Thou hast played the Harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me saith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abundant in goodness.</hi> Therefore can he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the evil of a Sinner:
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> He enables his people to overcome evil with good; much more can, and will he do it himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And abundant in truth.</hi> This may answer all thy doubts about God's promises to receive return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners: He often eminently asserts his truth in his Promises;
<note place="margin">Psalm 100.</note> — <hi>his truth endureth from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation.</hi> There have been famous proofs of the truth of God's Promises to such Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in all Ages; the Lord may say to all converted Sinners, <hi>Ye are my witnesses— Isa.</hi> 43.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pardoning iniquity, transgression, and sin.</hi> This is to prevent despair that might rise from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of sins and magnitude of sins.
<note place="margin">Isa. 55.7.</note>
                  <hi>Let the wicked turn to our God, for he will abundantly pardon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 1.</note> Hebr. he will multiply to pardon. <hi>Put away the evil of your doings, and then, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wooll.</hi> Scarlet and Crimson are colours of a deep die, nothing can thorowly wash them out; Yes,
<note place="margin">1 John 2.7.</note>
                  <hi>but the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth from all sin;</hi> even sins that have the most hellish and devilish tincture. The wooll of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries was exceeding white;
<note place="margin">Dan. 7.9.</note>
                  <hi>Psalm</hi> 147.16. <hi>He giveth snow-like wooll;</hi> pure wooll, as it was said of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94446:22"/>hair of the head of the Ancient of days, described there not in his Essence, but in his Presence. The expressions import,
<note place="margin">Ovid. Metam. lib. 15.</note> That God hath a white Stone (an Emblem of Absolution or Pardon, a custome among the Heathens) to give to the chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when repenting and returning to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keeping mercy for thousands.</hi> God is an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted fountain of mercy;
<note place="margin">James 2.13.</note> and therefore <hi>mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth or glorieth against judgment;</hi> as if there were a strife between Mercy and Judgment about sinners, and Mercy gets the victory: says the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah, He delighteth in mercy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 7.18.</note> Mercy is as pleasing to God as to the Sinner. As the motion, which the woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> made to <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Absolom</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from banishment, was as pleasing to <hi>David</hi> as to <hi>Joab,</hi> who had a hand in it; it's said,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.1.</note>
                  <hi>Joab per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the King's heart was towards</hi> Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solom.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>And that will by no means clear the guilty: i. e.</hi> That shall be guilty of despising and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing the former Attributes of God in this his <hi>Name,</hi> inviting Sinners to come in to him. When a Sinner comes to be contumacious and stubborn, and a presumptuous Sinner, then he is past mercy. As it is with some Felons, that are not allowed the Clergy: so it is with presumptuous Sinners, there was no Sacrifice in the Law for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Soul that doth ought presumptuously,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 15.30.</note> or with a high hand, <hi>the same reproacheth the Lord, and that Soul shall be cut off from among his people.</hi> So in <hi>Deuteronomy, If a man bless himself in his heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29.19, 20</note>
                  <hi>saying, I shall have peace though I walk in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination or stubbornness of mine heart— The Lord will not spare him, his anger and his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94446:23"/>jealousie shall smoak against that man, and all the Curses that are written in this Book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this last Clause of God's Name, <hi>And will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> is terrible indeed; but it's so only to the presumptuous and stubborn sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<note place="margin">Jer. 20.3, 4.</note> and it's enough to make such a sinner <hi>Magor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missabib,</hi> or fear round about, a terror to himself. But this part of God's <hi>Name</hi> takes not place, till all the former are rejected and despised.
<note place="margin">Hos. 5.15.</note> This, <hi>and by no means will clear the guilty,</hi> belongs not to those that acknowledge themselves to be guilty, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it accordingly. And this is the first Reason why God doth, and will so graciously receive self-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and repenting sinners, Because it is in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deal so with such.</p>
               <p>A second Ground or Reason of it is from the Son of God's espousing the nature of man, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> and that after the fall of man, on purpose to bring back lost man unto God.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note>
                  <hi>Christ hath once suffered for sins; i. e.</hi> in the sinners nature, that he might bring us to God, bring God and sinners together again, that he might reconcile and make them friends. When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ took on him actually the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2.14.</note> then the Angels sung <hi>on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed if God should not entertain returning sinners, and again take them into friendship, then did Christ take on him their nature in vain, and die in their nature in vain, and then is our preaching in vain, and your faith in vain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94446:23"/>
               <p>It is to no porpose for a sinner to think of addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself to an absolute God; there can be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse between God and him without Christ: Christ is the middle person that perswades with both. This is Christ's office and great work,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note> to bring God and sinners together.</p>
               <p>There are great differences between them, that cannot without him be taken up; but Christ can take up all: He brings Publicans and Harlots home to God; <hi>He preached peace to you that were afar off, as well as to them that were nigh, Eph.</hi> 2.17. Neither <hi>Moses,</hi> nor <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor <hi>Noah,</hi> nor <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> nor <hi>Job,</hi> might turn God's mind to the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. I but Jesus Christ hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mind of God towards the greatest of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners; <hi>Ye who were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled unto God,</hi> Col. 1.21.</p>
               <p>Now considering how the work of Redemption was wrought in our Nature, and God is manifested in the Flesh on purpose to be a Redeemer; that our Nature in him might be meritorious, and savable in us; that God was manifested in the flesh to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God offended by us; God was offended, and God was satisfied by God in the offenders Nature: How that the Scripture saith, The Father hath <hi>sent forth his Son to be a propitiation for the remission of sins;</hi> and <hi>the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost,</hi> Luke 19.10. I say, these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, are a second Demonstration of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness of God to receive returning Sinners.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace shews, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> that God doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intend to be gracious to sinners. Had God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the old Covenant of Works, or made a new
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94446:24"/>Covenant of Works, poor sinners had been where they were, because of their incapacity to perform the Conditions of such a Covenant: But the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being altered into a Covenant of Grace, the tearms are not, I will, if they will; but I will, and they shall;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.27.</note>
                  <hi>I will put my spirit within you, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for himself and us.</p>
               <p>And it is notably evident in the Scripture, that the great design of God in the Covenant of Grace was, and is, to advance the glory of his grace, his free grace, and that upon objects unlikeliest to natural Reason. The Gospel is made up of acts of grace; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.26. —<hi>You see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise—that no flesh should glory in his presence— The good pleasure of his will</hi> is his motive, and <hi>the praise of the glory of his grace</hi> is his end, in all his merciful actings towards sinners, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
               <p>God is gracious to repenting and returning sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>4</label> because he will be true to his word, and make good his promises to this purpose. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings— Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow</hi>—</p>
               <p>The import of the Phrase is, That upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they should have remission of sins, though they had been sinners of the greatest sort: And which is to be noted, God hath designed the Lord Jesus Christ <hi>to give repentance</hi> as well as <hi>remission of sins,</hi> Acts 5.32.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94446:24"/>
               <p>The holy Scriptures are full of promises and offers to poor Sinners, highly engaging to repentance for sin, and from sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way— and turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, and he will abundantly pardon him.</hi> That of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. answers this of the Prophet, <hi>Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou hast played the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot with many lovers, yet return again to me, saith the Lord. And come unto me,</hi> saith Jesus to Sinners labouring under the sense of sin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>and I will give you rest.</hi> Come unto me, and I will not bind heavy burthens, and grievous to be born, as the Scribes and Pharisees do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.4. but i'le take off their burthens, and i'le give you a light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; <hi>My yoke is easie, and my burthen is light, v.</hi> 30. Come unto me,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.37.</note> for <hi>him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</hi> Whom the Pharisees had cast out, Christ received, <hi>John</hi> 9. And it's to be observed, That Jesus Christ is said to have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from his Father thus to treat sinners; as he said <hi>John</hi> 12.49. <hi>The Father gave me a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what I should say</hi>— And so the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> That he and the other Apostles had Commission both from the Father and Son, to treat Sinners with the most winning offers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Embassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now for a Sinner to question whether God can forgive such sins as his, it is almost to act over <hi>Cain</hi>'s part, <hi>Mine iniquity is greater than can be forgiven.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> And if a Sinner question whether God will forgive him, and receive him upon his return, this is to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94446:25"/>truth it self, and his promises, for whom it is <hi>impossible to lie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The last Ground I shall mention of the Doctrine, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>5</label> is the Presidents which are upon Record by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost in the Case; as <hi>Adam</hi> that filled the World with sin; and <hi>Manasseth</hi> that filled <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with blood; yet these were pardoned Sinners upon their repentance and return to God.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal of mercy in setting down the patterns of mercy in great Sinners: St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith as much of himself, and his own Case: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 16. <hi>Who was a blasphemer, and a persecuter, and injurious, but I obtained mercy:</hi> And <hi>for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> saith in <hi>v.</hi> 13. though he had been a blasphemer, and a persecuter, yet he obtained mercy, because he did it ignorantly in unbelief: But this he says to shew that his blasphemy and persecution was not the sin against the holy Ghost, else he could not have obtained mercy: He acted out of his blind zeal, and not against knowledge, and of meer malice, as many of the Pharisees, and some of the Rulers did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. Some, not all; St. <hi>Peter</hi> clears some, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.17.—<hi>I wot that through ignorance ye did it,</hi> that is, put Christ to death, <hi>as did also your Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi>

It is at best sinful modesty for sinners to say so, or think so; but it is ordinarily rather the pride of their heart, than poverty of spirit. Despairing sinners are taught of the Devil to say and think <hi>their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is greater then can,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11.</note> or that it may <hi>be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> This is one of Satan's <gap reason="foreign">

Satan prevails upon many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Consciences, to think every one doth but flatter them, that seeks to take them off from their despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasonings.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94446:26"/>
               <p>Some sinners are so critical in their coming to God, that God may say to them in this point, as he did to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> in another, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee?</hi> Some would be humbled above God's measure, before they will come to him; and some under: Some would come to God with their sins, and some with hell in their souls: And thus who knows how many are damned by their own proud will, or wild humor. When a sinner is come to himself, and feels he is lost, and come out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> as to any succour there, now is the sinners time to come to God in Christ, or come unto God by Christ; and when he comes, God will fall on his neck, and kiss him, as the Father on his prodigal returning Son; he is sure of welcome, if he now return.</p>
               <p>It matters not out of what Countrey thou comest; how far distant thou hast been from God; though thou hast kept Swine as the Prodigal did; been the Devil's drudge; been a drunkard, a swearer, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vicious person; hast sinned such sins as the Devil himself sins not, yet hath tempted thee to sin, and thy base nature joyned with him in the temptation; yet still I say, if thou returnest to God, he'll receive thee; yet remember his words to <hi>Israel, Psalm</hi> 95. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4.7.</note>
                  <hi>harden not your heart:</hi> for as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> saith, <hi>he limiteth a certain day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O quash not motions, no not this days motions to return to God; the Devil may discourage thee from them, but God will not. When the Shepherd found his lost sheep, he did not throw his hook at it; but laid it on his shoulder, and brought it home: when God meets with a returning sinner, he doth not speak
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94446:26"/>in passion and wrath to him, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did to <hi>Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> but as tenderly as Jesus did to <hi>Peter</hi> the first time he met him after he denied him.</p>
               <p>And though a sinner have not legs of his own to return; yet if there be a mind to it,
<note place="margin">John 5.</note> as there was in the impotent man to go into the Pool, he shall go upon the legs of God's grace,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.20.</note> as that impotent man did: God hath <hi>laid help on one that is mighty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Jesus the great Shepherd of the sheep.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 19.10.</note> He is <hi>come to seek and to save that which is lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O then let the gracious dealing of God with this Prodigal invite thee, who art yet at a distance ftom God, now to return: This is much in God's mouth; <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? Ez.</hi> 33.11.
<note place="margin">Jer. 3.2.</note>
                  <hi>Yet return again unto me, saith the Lord.</hi> Such mercy and pity as this should be a Loadstone to thy heart; thy heart should be broken or melted,

<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note>
                  <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest:</hi> the invitation is to the worst of sinners, sensible of sin as a burthen. It is true, there is no mercy for any sinner without repentance, and there is mercy for great sinners with it. A sinner must come to himself before he come to God, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal did before he came to his Father, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94446:27"/>
               <p>As for measures of conviction and humiliation, take heed of the Devil's trap and snare here: Now thou art off of the danger of presumption, he plays his game of despair; but let this over-rule the Case, when it comes to be thine, That he hath the happiest measure of conviction and humiliation for sin, whose conviction and humiliation brings him out of himself to Christ.</p>
               <p>But sense of sin, and sorrow for sin there must be: If the Prodigal had not come to himself, when pinched with want, and thought his Father's house, and any service there, a better condition than the far Countrey; his Father had not had compassion on him. If any sinner will still be what he is, and do not repent, that he may return, he hath nothing to do with those parts of God's Name, <hi>Merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin;</hi> but that close of God's <hi>Name, And will by no means clear the guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what would sinners have of God? to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their sins? It's not possible; God sent his Son Jesus <hi>to save his people from their sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 2.21.</note>
                  <hi>and to turn them from their iniquity, Acts</hi> 3.26. If God should save a sinner in his sins, this is mercy that would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow his truth and justice: God will stand to his word, and receive thee graciously if thou repentest and returnest; but withal he must stand to his word, and save thee in a Scripture way, and in a way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to all his Attributes, which is by the way of repentance and returning to him. When sinners cannot rest in a state of sin, nor in a state of self-righteousness, but they see they must come to Christ for rest, he will bid these sinners welcome.</p>

                  </label> But is it in a convinced sinners power to return to God? The Scripture saith,

                  </label> That though the act of a sinners returning be in God's power, and not his own; as it's said of times and seasons, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. yet the sinner may seek it of God; <hi>Turn thou me, O Lord, and I shall be turned,</hi> said <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi> 31.18. Though it be God's work, yet he works it in the way of means, which sinners may and must use.</p>
               <p>And that a sinner does not return to God, it lies not so much in his Cannot, as in his Will not:
<note place="margin">Jer. 8.5.</note> They refuse to return.</p>

                  </label> and would live in sin, God regards not their prayers: But if thou comest to God affected with thy sinful state, God will regard thy prayers,
<note place="margin">Psal. 66.18.</note> though thou art not yet in a state of grace: It was <hi>Manasseh</hi> his case, and is indeed the case of most Converts: There are some things in those that are not yet converted, that are in order to their Conversion. Thy sense of thy distance from God, and desire of a return, why this is a less grace that makes way for a greater. This in answer to that Objection.</p>
               <p>O then, if the power of returning to God be in God's hand, sit not still, but seek it there. When all the Corn in <hi>Egypt</hi> was in <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Garners, should a poor Egyptian say, He had none, I have none, <hi>Joseph</hi> hath all at his disposing, so that I may sit still and starve?

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But this is one of the Devil's suggestions to poor sinners, who have but the thoughts of returning to God; and so let such look on it.</p>
               <p>Why will not you do in this case, as the Lepers did in theirs?
<note place="margin">2 Kings 7.</note>
                  <hi>If we sit still we die, if we go in to the Syrians we shall but die, it may be they may save us alive:</hi> and dare not you venture your souls on God, as well as those Lepers their lives on the Syrians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nineveh</hi> fell to prayer and fasting as well as they could, to prevent being destroyed, after sentence was pronounced upon them;
<note place="margin">Jonah 3.9.</note> And what was their encouragement? <hi>It may be, or who knoweth, or who can tell, if the Lord will turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there is no sinner, that hath a mind to return to God, but he hath as much encouragement to beg grace of him to return.</p>
               <p>Suppose there were but a possibility of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God in the use of God's means for it, why this is a mercy that the Angels which sinned never had since they sinned; they have no possibility of making peace with God: I but thou hast more than a possibility; there is probability to encourage thee. A sinner is in a probable way, whilst he seeks grace in the means of grace, as the impotent man was of Cure, while he lay by the Pool, <hi>John</hi> 5. And above this, though God be free in dealing forth his grace;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94446:28"/>and hath mercy on whom he will have mercy; and is gracious to whom he will be gracious, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. yet God hath left thee good assurance, if thou keep in the way of his instituted means for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of sinners; <hi>Ask and ye shall have, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you,</hi> Mark 7.7. <hi>I said not to the seed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>seek ye me in vain,</hi> Isa. 49.19.</p>
               <p>So that although the sense of thy lost condition, which is coming to thy self, as this Prodigal did; and thy thoughts and mindfulness of thy return to God, like the Prodigal to his Father; I say, though these be not thy return, yet they are in order to it; this is, as I said, less grace, to make way for greater. They are those that like their distance from God in their state of sin, that are likely to perish in that state; <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, John</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>But if God have given thee the will to return to him, he will give thee to do it; and in thy return thou wilt be graciously received, as the repenting, returning Prodigal was by his Father; for he was the representation of sinners in the case.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> If God will graciously receive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and returning sinner, then surely he will do so by a returning Saint: Saints are subject to relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and backslidings; the promise of Cure supposes the Distemper: <hi>I will heal their backslidings:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 14.4.</note> the like in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Return thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon thee; for I am merciful saith the Lord, and will not keep anger for ever; only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast scattered thy ways to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers—</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94446:29"/>
               <p>Nay, above this, relapsing Saints have not only a promise of a gracious reception upon their return; but they have a promise,
<note place="margin">Jer. 57.17, 18.</note> that they shall return to their vigour in grace; <hi>He went on frowardly in the way of his heart; I have seen his ways, and will heal him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.61.</note>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> rose from his fall presently; at a look of Jesus he got up again. And it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table what tender care our Lord Jesus took so soon as he was risen, that <hi>Peter</hi> should be comforted in his sorrow for his fall, lest he should be swallowed up of overmuch sorrow, which is a design of Satans in the case, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>And therefore Christ dispatched an Angel to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 16.</note> to acquaint him with his being risen again. And Jesus himself appeared to <hi>Peter</hi> first of all the Disciples,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 15.5.</note> when he was risen from the dead.</p>
               <p>But my Brethren, I beseech you consider this, That it is better to prevent a disease, than to be healed of it: for the prevention of relapses prevents much pain and grief of Soul. O then let Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be watchful to prevent distances between God and them; and you that have made such, in leaving your first Love,
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.4. Jer. 2.2.</note> and have receded from the kindness of your youth, and have abated of your former humble and close walking with God, your former delight and power in prayer— O bethink your selves of coming to your selves, and of your returning to God, in holy and humble converse with him.</p>
               <p>Till then your bones continue out of joint, as <hi>David</hi>'s were,
<note place="margin">Psal. 22.14.</note> and the pain in setting them is to come; and though they be set, yet you may halt of them ever after,
<note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> as <hi>Jacob</hi> did upon the blow the Angel gave him on his thigh; yet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94446:29"/>this is better than not to return to your former lively and active state in grace.</p>
               <p>O therefore, ye backsliding Christians, resolve as she did <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I will go and return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than now:</hi> and your returning must be with melting hearts; <hi>They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them.</hi> Backsliding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should grieve and trouble more at their parting with God, than <hi>Micah</hi> did, when his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols were taken away;

               <p>And our Saviour first holds forth to our view and consideration, the younger Son, a Prodigal; and the Picture of every natural man.</p>
               <p>And first, we have his proud and peremptory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, or rather Demand, of his Father; <hi>Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me:</hi> He would have his Father make his Will, and be his own Executor in his life; yea presently.</p>
               <p>There are two things observable in this youngster. 1. He would have his Portion in his own hand, and be at his own finding; he would cast off his Father, and be independent: A strange thing! Fathers sometimes cast off their Sons; but here the Son casts off the Father, and will give no account of any thing he has or does: He gets his Portion into his own hand, and then goes <hi>into a far Countrey, v.</hi> 12. and part of the 13th.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This proud and heady Course of his was the cause of all his ensuing woes and misery: For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed, 1. His Luxury, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>And there wasted his substance with riotous living.</hi> 2. His Calamity followed his Luxury at the heels, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in the land, and he began to be in want.</hi> He
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94446:31"/>satisfied his lusts, until he had nothing left to satisfie Nature.</p>
               <p>And these two literal things in the Parable yield us these two spiritual Points of Doctrine, intended by him who spake the Parable.</p>

               <p>And this lust of his to leave God, and provide better for himself, as he thought, than did God, broke forth at a short temptation; Satan soon got his ear and heart to this cursed way, to cast off God, and to be as God himself; he sought to be an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent being; in plain terms, to be no more a Creature;
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.5.</note> —<hi>Ye shall be as Gods:</hi> He took off his heart from God, to be a God himself. And man left God at first on a double account or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

<note place="margin">Psal. 16.</note> as <hi>David</hi> said of his. He had hard thoughts of God, because he had put a restraint upon him from eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil;
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> he received a conceit that God kept him too much under, the Devil's own sin, who in dislike left his first estate, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. out of an aspiring mind to a higher estate than an Angels. So that man's first conception of sin lay in high thoughts of himself, and hard thoughts of God; and the nature of man hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the infection, and is apt to have high conceits of self, and hard conceits of God, as that King had 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. <hi>This evil is of the Lord, what should I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi>

               <p>It is God's restraining grace that keeps the world of natural men from this Atheism; as he said to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech,</hi>

                  <hi>who is Lord over us.</hi> My Brethren, whilst we seek to please our selves, and to be self-depending, what is this less then to seek to be as Gods? this was it that man sought for at the

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.5.</note> saith the Serpent when he tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> and she soon nibbled at this bait.</p>
               <p>When men are and will be their own motives and ends, they are as Gods unto themselves.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 14.3.</note> Carnal men make many Gods, they set up Idols in their hearts; and as they make Gods to themselves, so they make themselves their chief God: as it was said of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Indeed men cannot but own themselves Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in asking and receiving, as the Prodigal here, <hi>Father give me my portion:</hi> but then they are, or would be Gods in using what they receive; for let them receive wealth, or beauty, or strength, or honor, or parts, <hi>they consume them upon their lusts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 4.3.</note> And this way a man makes a God of himself, his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and lust is his end in all. Nay, and in some respects men would be as Gods in receiving; for they would have to the uttermost of their minds and phansies. Our first Parents would have had more than God gave them, though he gave them all this lower world, and much of the world above too; his own image and likeness, and near communion with himself, and power to have kept this blessed state; yet they thought not this enough, it sufficed them not, but they would be as Gods.</p>
               <p>And still men would live, and do live,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> as <hi>without God in the world,</hi> as the Apostle saith. And this is one Reason, and a chief one, why natural men
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94446:33"/>refuse grace, because grace layeth man low, and raises God high: grace casts man out of himself, and prompts him to self-denial,

                  <p>Man naturally loves change of states and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as feaverish palates do change of beer, and it may be none will please. This Prodigal liked not to live with his Father, nor near home; he must go into a far Countrey. It may in some sort be said of every natural mans heart,
<note place="margin">Dan. 4.16.</note> as of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars, a beasts heart was given unto him.</hi> Man would have change of pasture, as some beasts will not stay

                     <note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> but all men in the first man left theirs; Man still wants something. <hi>Amnon,</hi> though a King's Son, yet was as if he wanted all,

                  </p>

                  <p>Man is very much a dissatisfied and discontented Creature, till grace comes, and much grace: It was much grace that brought St.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> to so conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a mind. And this is one Reason why naturally man would be loose from God, and left to himself, because he is so uncertain and unstable a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>A second Reason of the Doctrine is from the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in all natural men; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> this makes them to leave God, and live on self.</p>
                  <p>First, a natural man's ignorance of himself; he knows not, or considers not, what it is to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so weak a Creature as himself is; for if he did, he would not trust so much, as its plain he doth, to his own strength; strength of parts, or strength of purposes, or strength of phansie: vain man would be wise, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his own thoughts, in contriving his own happiness,

<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:94446:34"/>
                  <p>If holy men think themselves, at least some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, not to have <hi>the understanding of a man,</hi> as <hi>Hagur, Prov.</hi> 30.2. <hi>but foolish and ignorant as a beast,</hi> as <hi>Asaph, Psal.</hi> 73.22. What is the natural man's wisdom? the Apostle saith, Their wisdom makes them fools;
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.22.</note>
                     <hi>professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</hi> The wisest of meer natural men, and the learnedst, know not enough what it is to be Creatures, and through this ignorance would be as Gods.</p>
                  <p>For what is it to be a Creature? not to be of our selves,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.</note> or to our selves, not to be our own; <hi>Ye are not your own,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and so <hi>whatever ye do,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.31.</note>
                     <hi>do all to the glory of God.</hi> And therefore when men would live of themselves, and to themselves, they would live above the capacity of Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Some great men, through this ignorance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, have aspired to be Gods over other men: So did the Prince of <hi>Tyrus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 28.2.</note>
                     <hi>Thou hast said I am a God, I sit in the seat of God:</hi> And <hi>Herod</hi> was well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the people cried him up for a God.
<note place="margin">Acts 12.22.</note> And <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great could scarce be content to be a man; and every man that hath not grace enough to make him the more humble and modest (for as grace is given to the humble, so grace maketh humble) every man would be as God to himself; he would please himself, and live to himself; he would be his own rule, and his own end, and serve his own turn on God as well as men.</p>
                  <p>Now, I say, this is because men naturally are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what it is to be a Creature; what it is to be of another, and for another; even of God, and for God;
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note>
                     <hi>of him, and through him, and to him are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94446:34"/>all things.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note>
                     <hi>The Lord hath made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> The wheel spins not for it self, but for him that made it, and him that bought it: and so the Ax cuts not for it self. By living of, or to our selves, we do, as far as we can, overthrow our being Creatures: and men consider not the evil of offering to sit in the seat of God.</p>
                  <p>Suppose other Creatures should be to themselves, should be proud towards us, as we are prone to be towards God, and should refuse to do our service and work, as we too often do by God, we would think it a strange <hi>ataxie,</hi> and the course of nature to be quite inverted; we should say as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> of the great and unexpected Eclipse at Christ's death, <hi>Deus naturae patitur;</hi> the God of Nature suffereth; this is the spirit of a man towards God, wherever there is not grace, and so much grace to teach us better. Though he made us, yet we have an itch to be our own, to serve our own turn, and not his; and in doing so, we seek so much as in us lyeth, to alter our selves from the condition of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our ignorance of God makes us to turn our back upon him; men see not a sufficiency of good in God, and so they look for it elsewhere. God is an unknown God to the most of men; and though they profess him, yet that may be written on their Profession, which was upon the Altar that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saw at <hi>Athens, To the unknown God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 17.23. Psal. 50.21.</note> Many men phansie God to be like themselves. Through deceit <hi>they refuse to know me, saith the Lord, Isa.</hi> 9.6. and <hi>every man is brutish in his knowledge,</hi> Jer. 10.14.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:94446:35"/>
                  <p>What is the reason that the Saints depend on God, and dare not scatter their trust to Creatures? because they know him, and have acquaintance with him;
<note place="margin">Psal. 9.10. Jer. 24.7.</note>
                     <hi>They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee:</hi> God gives them a heart to know him: and this was the reason why <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would be his own Lord, <hi>I know not the Lord, Exod.</hi> 5.7. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men know not the Lord so, as to know that their happiness is bound up in him, as <hi>Judah</hi> said, that <hi>his fathers life was in the lads life, Gen.</hi> 44.30. Therefore men leave God, and rely on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or some other Creature; <hi>She did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oyl, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed her silver and gold, wherewith they made Baal;</hi> so these last words are in the <hi>Margin, Hos.</hi> 2.8.</p>
                  <p>There is a natural instinct in all men to desire to be happy, but where this Golden vein lyes, every man by nature is to seek; men are scepticks or seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers indeed in this; but miss as much, or more than they that make experiment of the Philosophers Stone.</p>
                  <p>The wisest men of this world have abounded in their conjectures of it; there have been fourscore, some say a hundred, of distinct opinions in the case, <hi>viz.</hi> wherein true happiness lieth, and all have been mistaken: For it is to be observed, they have all seated the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> man's chief good, in the Creatures, and not in God.</p>
                  <p>But grace teacheth us to find it in God, and in God alone,
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.25.</note> in the enjoyment of God himself; <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none on earth that I desire besides thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94446:35"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon,</hi> who might better be called Nature's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary than <hi>Aristotle,</hi> ransack'd the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>all things under the Sun</hi> for it, but found it not; only <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit</hi> instead of it.</p>
                  <p>Every Creature answered <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he sought felicity in them, as the Depths and the Sea answer men who seek wisdom in them,
<note place="margin">Job 28.14.</note>
                     <hi>It is not in me,</hi> nor it is <hi>not in me.</hi> Men set up false marks, when they aim at contentation and satisfaction in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature excellency; so that if they do hit the mark they aim at, they hit a false mark. Suppose a man aim to be happy in riches, or honour, or pleasures, or moral vertues, or parts, or humane learning, and suppose he hit the mark he aims at for happiness; why he hits a false mark, and so is as far from true happiness as before he took his aim.</p>
                  <p>The enjoyment of all these, laid to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God himself,
<note place="margin">Isa. 55.2.</note> are but as <hi>Esau</hi>'s Pottage to the Blessing or Birthright; <hi>Men lay out their strength for that which satisfieth not, and their money for that which is not bread,</hi> who hunt for happiness in the Creature: They are like a man sick of a Fever, O if he had but drink, how well should he be! but this is the cry of his Distemper; for give him drink to his mind, and it does but feed his Disease, not satisfie Nature, but disturb it more.</p>
                  <p>It's considerable what the Lord saith in this case, <hi>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 9.23.</note>
                     <hi>nor the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, &amp;c.</hi> Acquaintance with God is more to a man's peace and composure of mind than all the former; <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94446:36"/>now thy self with him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 12.21.</note>
                     <hi>and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, we may seek comfort in the Creature, and find it; yet it's imperfect comfort; it's comfort but in part: As we know here but in part. We may look for light from the Moon, and have it; but we may not think to find the light of the Sun in the Moon. And as great a difference there is between the Joy we may have in the Creature, and that we may have in God;
<note place="margin">Psal. 104.34. Psal. 16.5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>My meditation of him shall be sweet.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;</hi> he adds, <hi>the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What vertue God hath put into the Creature, we may seek it; but when we find it, it is to mind us of much more to be found in God: God intends not that the comfort we find in any of the Creatures should draw our hearts from him, but to him, and more to him than before:
<note place="margin">Josh. 15.19.</note>
                     <hi>Caleb</hi>'s daughter must have the upper springs with the neather in her bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. In a word, we must seek God in the Creature, as <hi>Jacob</hi> saw God in <hi>Esau</hi>'s face, and seek the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for God, as well as our selves, or else we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the way to true comfort and content in both, which method no natural man observeth. And thus much for the second Reason of the point.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> man's pride makes him turn his back upon God, and think to stand by himself: Man is naturally a proud Creature, as the sinning Angels were; man is among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of pride;
<note place="margin">Job 42.3 Psal. 10.4.</note>
                     <hi>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.</hi>

                  <p>What is pride but an opinion of a man's self-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and self-excellency? as we see in that proud Pharisee, <hi>I am not as other men,</hi>

                     <hi>come not near to me, for I am holier than thou:</hi> This is the dialect and language of pride; it is the vent of tow'ring thoughts of a man's self: You may more easily pull down the strongest Castle, than the proud heart of man. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was long plagued before he would own God; <hi>Who is the Lord,</hi>

                  <p>Man is not easily made nothing in his own thoughts; he very hardly owns his need and want in spirituals: <hi>I am rich, and want nothing,</hi>

                  <p>The pride of man's heart hath a hand in those two soul-undoing sins, that keep men off from God, Presumption and Despair. Presumers,
<note place="margin">Psal. 10.</note>
                     <hi>through the pride of their countenance, will not seek after God:</hi> and Despairers will see some worth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before they will go to God. It is not usually through the excess, but defect of humiliation, that souls in despair will not cast themselves on Christ, as they said <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>There is no hope;</hi> No: <hi>I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</hi> Despair
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94446:37"/>is a proud sin, as well as Presumption: It made <hi>Spira</hi> wish he were above God.</p>
                  <p>The pride of man is a greater barr against the grace of God,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.31.</note> than grosser sins; <hi>Verily I say unto you, that the Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you.</hi> Meer civil men need more humbling, in some respects, than grosser sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, because they have more to be proud of. It's self-liking and self-flattering that keeps a man upon his own bottom.</p>
                  <p>And as a man is prone to like himself, so to seek himself is at the end of all his actions; whether he pray, or preach, or hear, or confer, or trade, or eat, &amp;c. self is his bias: And as proud man seeks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so he is self-depending; he lays the stress of duties on his parts, and the stress of reforming any sin upon his own purposes and resolutions, and his successes upon his own worth or wisdom.</p>
                  <p>To this the Lord saw the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to be inclined,
<note place="margin">Judg. 7.2.</note>—<hi>lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</hi> See the reasoning between <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.19, 21. <hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is a holy God, he is a jealous God. Nay, but we will serve the Lord.</hi> There is a tang of this in the spirits of godly persons; for alas, how seldom do they act grace, or in duty so, as considering that God must help the acts of grace, as well as give the habits? But for natural men, the Lord may say to them as to <hi>Edom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 49.16.</note>
                     <hi>The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, thou hast cast of God, and relied on thine own strength.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>4</label> Passion and peevishness in the nature of man begets prejudices against God: As natural men cannot please God, so God cannot please them. There is something of this leaven in God's own people, and the most eminent of them:

                     <hi>David</hi> was <hi>displeased,</hi> because the Lord had made a breach upon <hi>Ʋzzah:</hi>

                  <p>It cannot be said of God and his people, as it was of <hi>David</hi> and his, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. <hi>Whatsoever the King did, it pleased the people;</hi> nay too often, much of that that we vent in prayer, or under the name of prayer, is but passion, and the effect of a feverish distemper on our spirits.

               <p>WE have already seen the inclination and lusting desire that is in man to forsake God, and the Reasons of it: I shall now proceed to apply the consideration hereof in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Uses. And</p>
               <p>This informs us of the sinfulness of man's nature, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> yea of the exceeding sinfulness of sin in man. For as the School-men say, Sin is a turning from God to the Creature, chiefly to a man's self, and his own Will.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, sin is more than this; it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising of God, it makes men speak against God; <hi>The people spake against God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 21.5.</note> to turn their spirits against God; to multiply words against God;
<note place="margin">Job 15.13. Job 34.37.</note> to speak <hi>marvellous things against the God of Gods, Dan.</hi> 11.36. The Serpents words to the woman at first stick to us still, <hi>Ye shall be as Gods</hi>— And if God should let men have their own way and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, he would soon lose himself in the world:
<note place="margin">Psal. 10.4.</note> wicked men would turn God out of the world, as well as out of their thoughts. And wherefore?
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> man would be God of this world, as well as the Devil. Men are naturally Polytheists, for many Gods. Some make <hi>their belly their God, Phil.</hi> 3.10. others make silver and gold their God;
<note place="margin">Dan. 5.23.</note>
                  <hi>They praised the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94446:39"/>Gods of silver and gold;</hi> yea to make Devils their Gods, <hi>they sacrificed to Devils, Deut.</hi> 32.17. to make their own Lusts their Gods, —<hi>serving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers lusts</hi>— Man would have any Gods rather than the true God;
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> but especially he is inclined to make a God of himself. That <hi>ye shall be as Gods,</hi> pleased our first Parents well. Man would have the disposing of his Estate in his own hand: he thinks he can do better for himself than God does.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Alphonso</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> said, as story reports, That if he had been of God's Counsel at the Creation, some things should have been better contrived. Ah thinks many a man with himself, and in his heart, If I had but my life, and health, and strength, and whole condition in my own power, then I should be a happy man. Thus is man in the fall, fallen from God to himself, and would be what himself would. When God will have him poor, he would be rich; and when God will have him low, he would be high: If it were in his power, almost nothing should be with him as it is, or as it is in the world.</p>
               <p>Most men would be Rulers in the world;

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:94446:39"/>time. Oh how eager is our nature to be freed from God's will, and left to our own? then things should not only be altered in the World, but in the Word of God; the holy Scriptures themselves should come under an <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> we see it at <hi>Rome;</hi> much of the Commandments, Threatnings, and Decrees of God should be blotted out: Men would be without the Word of God, or above it, as the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church of Rome</hi> presume to be. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour told the Pharisees and Scribes, That for the Commandments of God they had obtruded the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men,
<note place="margin">Mark 7.8, 13.</note> and that <hi>they made the word of God of none effect by their Traditions.</hi> Yea,
<note place="margin">Dan. 11.</note> there are more than <hi>Antiochus Epiphaues,,</hi> that would do what they will, and exalt themselves, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie themselves above every God.

               <p>Grace makes a man desirous to be <hi>in subjection to the Father of Spirits;</hi> to be at his disposing; to begin to speak like Jesus Christ; <hi>yet not my will, but thine be done:</hi> Grace hath always brought men to this spirit and temper, <hi>good is the word of the Lord, Isa.</hi>

               <p>The Viper may stick a while on <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand,

                  <hi>Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain;</hi>— here was his temptation, but what was his resolution? to the contrary; he abhorr'd the temptation, and himself too, where he indulged it in the least. <hi>If I say I will speak thus, behold I should offend against the generation of thy Children: so foolish was I, and ignorant, I was

                  </label> that he is such an altered Creature from his original. God made man a companion for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he did the woman for the man; though he needed not man's society as <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>Eves:</hi> Therefore he made man in his own Image,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26. 1 Cor. 11.7.</note> and after his own likeness, as he did the womans to the man's.</p>
               <p>But man hath lost his likeness and his love to God together: Man naturally cares not for God's company; he hides himself from God, or would if he could, as <hi>Adam</hi> did; and goes out of the presence of God,

               </p>
               <p>Such a man as <hi>Jonah went out of the presence of

               <p>Lastly, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Let us all make observation of our own spirits in this point: There is a difference in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the godly themselves in the case. Some are more carnal, and walk as men, as it was with some of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> others are more spiritual,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> and walk as Saints indeed.
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28. Psal. 10.4.</note> Natural men <hi>like not to retain God in their knowledge,</hi> nor in their thoughts: They are weary of his presence, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. and weary of his service;
<note place="margin">Mal. 1.13.</note>
                  <hi>what a weariness is it?</hi> weary of those that are like to God, as the <hi>Sodomites were of Lot.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 8.34.</note> The <hi>Gergesenes</hi> wished Jesus himself <hi>to depart out of their Coasts.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:94446:43"/>
               <p>But there is another spirit in the truly godly, their desire is to <hi>set the Lord always before them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 16.8. Psal. 42.1. Lam. 3.24. Psal. 27.7.</note> To live with him, to live upon him. They would not be at liberty from God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, nor from his Government, nor from his Disposing. They are afraid to be left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Now observe your own spirits how like you are to these, and how unlike the other: If you have Grace, the tendency of your Soul is towards God,
<note place="margin">Isa. 26.9.</note> and not from him. <hi>With my soul have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early.</hi> The corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cries, Divide the heart between God and thy Lusts, and between God and other things, as that Harlot cry'd,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 3. Psal. 119.10.</note>
                  <hi>Divide the Child:</hi> But Grace votes for God to have the whole heart; <hi>with my whole heart have I sought thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore any hard thoughts arise in thee of God, look upon the Flesh, and that unclean Spirit the Devil,
<note place="margin">Job 2.</note> to joyn in the evil motion. Satan would perswade others besides <hi>Job</hi> to curse God; he will insinuate and suggest to you after the manner of <hi>Absolom</hi> to <hi>Hushai,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.17.</note>
                  <hi>Is this thy kindness to thy friend?</hi> So will Satan seek to make thy heart secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reproach God when thou art under hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations of Providence by himself, or by harsh and cruel men; Is this God's kindness to his friends, to let them be so harshly dealt with?</p>
               <p>I, but lay things together, and wisely consider of God's doings,
<note place="margin">Psal. 64.9. Psal. 73.1.</note> as the Psalmist said, and then you will say, <hi>Yet God is good to every one that is of a clean heart.</hi> O take heed of making any ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on God, either on his Word, or Works, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94446:43"/>Decrees, or Attributes; this is the way to be tempted to leave God, and stand upon your own bottoms, as this Prodigal did; Give me my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goods, and I'le be gone. I, but what follows? This leads to the second Particular, Point or Doctrine,</p>
               <p>That mens leaving and casting off God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to live of themselves, and to be at their own dispose, is the cause of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much sin and sorrow in their lives. Of which in the following Chapter.</p>

               <head type="sub">
                  <hi>Wherein follows the Second general Doctrine resulting from the First Part of the Parable: shewing both the sinful and miserable consequences of mens forsaking of God. The gross mistake of most men herein; and the Means to be used for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have finished the first general Doctrine from the first part of the Parable, <hi>viz.</hi> That every man by nature hath a lusting desire to leave God, to stand upon his own legs, and to be at his own disposal. Let us now see the sad effects hereof in the second general Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That mens leaving and casting off God's Government, to live of themselves, and to be at their own dispose, is the cause of very much sin and sorrow in their lives.</p>
               <p>This was the younger Son's case in this Parable, he leaves his Father, and is led by his own Lusts, and at last comes to great penury and drudgery; he kept Swine, and eat with them too; he fed them, and fed of the same meat with them, and at length could not get that; he would gladly have filled his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94446:44"/>belly with the Husks which the Swine did eat, but could not get them.</p>
               <p>It's to be observed, that his first step to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was his thoughts of returning to his Fathers house; and his first step to misery was his leaving his Father. And thus it is with every man that waves the will of God, as to his Rule, and follows his own. It is his undoing, he now becomes a man of sin and sorrow, as <hi>to leave father and mother, &amp;c.</hi> for God, is the way to be a blessed man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; as it was said of <hi>Levi,</hi> who said to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and to his Mother,
<note place="margin">Deut. 33.9, 11.</note>
                  <hi>I have not seen him</hi>— And what followeth? <hi>Bless Lord his substance, and accept the work of his hands, and strike through the loyns of them that rise against him.</hi> So to leave God, and follow our selves or men, it is the high way to sin and sorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they forsake me, I will forsake them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.16, 17.</note> and many evils and troubles shall befall them. When those Jews in the 42. and 43. of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> rejected the Word of the Lord for their stay in their own Country, and would go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> they there perished miserably.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Jonah</hi> fled from the presence of the Lord, he met with a rough Sea,
<note place="margin">Jonah 2.2.</note> and was cast into it, and swallowed <hi>into the belly of hell.</hi> And what a deluge of sin and sorrow did <hi>Adam</hi> bring upon the World by casting off the will of God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.12. and 8.22.</note> and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own? God said eat not; he would eat: this brought him and all the World under sin and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the whole Creation into a groaning state.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94446:45"/>
               <p>Yea, in any sin that a man doth knowingly and deliberately, he casts off God: Thus did <hi>Saul</hi> when he spared <hi>Agag,</hi> &amp;c. contrary to his express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Thou hast rejected the word of the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> And when a man rejects his Word, he rejects the Lord himself. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me,</hi>

                  <hi>and he that despiseth you, despiseth me.</hi> I say, where a man doth any thing he knoweth to be sin, or neglects to do any known duty, when he doth thus deliberately, and not through the transport of a temptation, he rejects the Lord, and gives him reason to reject him:
<note place="margin">Num. 3.3.</note> But God keeps his Covenant when we break it; our unfaithfulness makes not the faith or fidelity of God of none effect: <hi>His mercy endureth for ever:</hi> He taketh not the many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we give;
<note place="margin">Psal. 103.10.</note>
                  <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our sins,</hi> saith <hi>David</hi> by experience. O how often do we cast off God, and yet he will be our God still! He keeps his Covenant when we break it; therefore is that Promise, <hi>I will heal their backslidings;</hi>

                  <hi>I will love them freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an accursed disposition in every man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to cast off God, and to do our own will; and he that knows not this by himself, knows not his own heart enough, but is a stranger there: Every heart by nature is poisoned with this, though it may be unseen to us, as <hi>Laban's</hi> Gods were to <hi>Jacob,</hi> though in his House.</p>
               <p>And the Reason why men thus cast of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>
                  </label> is the prejudice they have at his ordering their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; men usually like not God's way he taketh with them. When he brought <hi>Israel</hi> into the Wilderness, then they had rather have been in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> we are too apt to be displeased at God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94446:46"/>of us,
<note place="margin">Gen. 48.17.</note> as <hi>Joseph</hi> was at the manner of his Father's blessing his two Sons; and the Reason is because we pass a Judgment on God's disposals by sight,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> and not by faith: Now sight is a false Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium to take a view of Providence by, which is much more the object of faith, as the Creation is; <hi>By faith we understand that the worlds were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the word of God.</hi> A Staff that is streight when looked on through the air, seems crooked if looked on in the water.</p>
               <p>But I come to speak to the two Branches of the Doctrine, That to cast off God, and follow self, leads men into abundance of sin and sorrow. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of sin: It's a notorious inlet to sin; it pulls up the sluces and floodgates of wickedness, and brings in a deluge of sin and ungodliness.</p>
               <p>For 1. it's certain that the knowledge of God, and acquaintance with him, is the only sufficient barr against sin. <hi>Joseph's</hi> acquaintance with God was his preservation against the importunate temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Mistress;
<note place="margin">Gen. 39.9.</note>
                  <hi>How can I do this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and sin against God? The servants of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Governours bare rule over the people,</hi> that is, used their pleasure on them, <hi>but so did not I,</hi> saith <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 5.15.</note>
                  <hi>because of the fear of God.</hi> To have God much and aright in our thoughts, is a forcible Caveat against all sin: As it is a powerful barr, so it is an universal barr against sin; it keeps from all sorts of sin, because all sin is against God. When a man so knows God, as to reverence him in his thoughts, and to close with his will, this is both a powerful and universal barr to sin.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94446:46"/>
               <p>A man's reason and parts, and his natural Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may be a fence against some sins, but not all; there are sins that any of these Hedges will let in: Nothing is a sufficient fence against all sin,
<note place="margin">Psal. 4.4.</note> but a holy aw of God; <hi>Stand in aw, and sin not.</hi> The Devil cannot easily tempt to sin where the Word of God is <hi>hid in the heart;</hi> thus saith S.

                  <hi>John</hi> to those young men 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.14. <hi>I write unto you young men, because ye are strong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one.</hi>

               <p>And again, as a man's reason and parts, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conscience may be curbs from some sins, so may shame from others, but these are only outside sins; for shame is no barr against sins within doors. Lusts may swarm there; there may be iniquity and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie to the full within, notwithstanding the thing we call shame.</p>
               <p>There are no bounds against sins within doors, but an holy aw of God, and his holy Word; a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these always before us, as <hi>David</hi> did.
<note place="margin">Psal. 16.8. Psal. 10.4.</note> But when men put God from their thoughts and minds, as those Professors of wisdome among the Gentiles did, of whom the Apostle speaks in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22, 28. <hi>As they did not like to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient</hi>—I say, when men cast God out from their minds, then they sin with the greatest freedom: <hi>Our lips are our

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 18.12.</note> This is the first demonstration of men's leaving God to be the inlet to sin, because there is no power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and universal barr to sin, but a reverend, hearty, and experimental knowledge of, and acquaintance with God.</p>

<note place="margin">Psal. 81.11, 12.</note>
                  <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would none of me: so I gave them up unto their own hearts lusts.</hi> When men cast off the true God, he casts them under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a lying Spirit,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 22.</note> as he did <hi>Ahab's</hi> Prophets: <hi>The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.</hi> Observe what follows,
<note place="margin">Psal. 14.2.</note>
                  <hi>They are corrupt, they have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable works.</hi> Thus for the Reasons of the first Branch.</p>
               <p>The Reasons of the second Branch of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That mens leaving God lets in upon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of sorrow. When <hi>Cain</hi> went out of the presence of God,
<note place="margin">Jer. 20. Gen. 4.14.</note> he was a man of fears, and a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to himself, as <hi>Pashur</hi> was; <hi>I shall be a fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</hi> The reason of this is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because God will fill a man with his own ways, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.30. <hi>They would none of my counsel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</hi> The Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal had enough of his farr Countrey, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> of the Flesh they lusted after: <hi>He that soweth to the flesh,</hi>

                  <hi>shall of the flesh reap cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: They have sown the wind, and they shall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94446:47"/>reap the whirlwind.</hi> That is a plain Text in the case in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 50.11.</note>
                  <hi>Behold all ye that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire, that compass your selves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled: this shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In this case God observes the Law of Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Eye for eye,</hi>

                  <hi>tooth for tooth</hi>— Where men cast off God, he will cast off them; here is the Law of Retaliation. Thus said <hi>David</hi> on his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to his Son <hi>Solomon, If thou forsake him,</hi>

<note place="margin">Jonah 2.8.</note>
                  <hi>They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies.

                  <p n="1">1. This shews us the gross and grievous mistake, I would I might not say of most men, to call that their happiness which is indeed their misery, that is to be loose from God and his Word, and to be tied to their own wills, and led by their own lusts. O how many think it a fine World when they can say, <hi>Our lips are our own,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 12.</note>
                     <hi>who is Lord over us?</hi> Men think this a mercy, but the Lord deliver me from such mercy, said St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> That which men think their mercy, is their misery.</p>
                  <p>It is better for us that God hedge up our way with thorns, <hi>i. e.</hi> with difficulties and distresses, than let us take our own way, and run wild, as we are by nature;
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.24.</note> for <hi>man is a wild Ass, used to the Wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> If God did not hedge up mens way, they would be mostly upon the Devil's Commons: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake God,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> and the God of this World hath you in his paws, and at his will.</p>
                  <p>Whilst a man is farr from God,
<note place="margin">Psal. 119.115.</note> Salvation is farr from him; yea, the further any man's thoughts and desires, and cares are from God, the nearer Satan is to that man to enter into him, as he did into <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi> For if Satan will get to a man's <hi>right hand</hi> when he <hi>stands before the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 3.2.</note> as he did to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> the Jews High Priest, he will get into his heart when he is out of God's presence.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:94446:48"/>
                  <p>We read in <hi>Job</hi> 1.6.
<note place="margin">Job 1.6.</note> how Satan got among the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels when they presented themselves before the Lord; (not that Satan comes into Heaven; for God and his holy Angels may be there where Satan may also be; in the air, or upon the earth: It is a similitude from earthly Kings;
<note place="margin">1 Kings 22.</note>) how much more may Satan joyn himself to men that are at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from God?
<note place="margin">Psal. 10.4.</note> when their thoughts and minds are remote from God, than Satan is nigh them to influence them, and to be a <hi>lying Spirit</hi> to them,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 22.22.</note> and in them, as he was in <hi>Ahab's Prophets;</hi> he shews them happiness and pleasure in doing their own wills and lusts, which proves but a cheat, like Juglers tricks.</p>
                  <p>That day wherein a man is a stranger to God, is a day of Errors, and a day of Terrors in the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not in the birth: It's thought a fine thing for every man to do <hi>that which is right in his own eyes.</hi> If men might do what they would,
<note place="margin">Judges 17.6.</note> and have what they list, without check from God's Word and their own Conscience, O this would be a brave World with many men! but alas, this will be to them as abundance of flesh was to <hi>Israel,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Num. 11.33.</note> this sweet meat would be sawced with the wrath of God, as the <hi>Quails</hi> were; and the sweetness of their own lusts would be to them as abhorring as <hi>Tamar</hi> was to <hi>Amnon;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.15.</note> and as meat on which a man surfeits.</p>
                  <p>So that it's a thousand times better to have our judgments, reason, wills, and affections under God's command and power then our own: It's infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly better to abide with God, than to be loose from him in any of our faculties or ways. God never did any man hurt that set his heart upon him; but all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94446:49"/>other things do; yea, they undo us when we set our hearts upon them;
<note place="margin">Isa. 55.2.</note> we now <hi>spend our money for that which is not bread; and our labour for that which sufficeth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O then, if ever you will do your selves good, acquaint your selves much with God.
<note place="margin">Job 22.21.</note> A man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, need not say as many do, <hi>Who will shew us any good?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 4.6.

                  </p>
                  <p>All your projects and contrivances for content out of God's way,
<note place="margin">Hos. 9.14.</note> will be but as <hi>miscarrying wombs, and dry breasts.</hi> You may sometimes conceit that God deals hardly with you,
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.12, 13.</note> worse then with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, as <hi>Asaph</hi> under a temptation did, and as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 10.3. but these good men eat their words, and recall'd their error; <hi>So foolish was I, and ignorant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 42.3.</note> said the one; <hi>I have uttered that which I understood not,</hi> says the other. Doubtless God's worst is better than the World's best, or Satan's best, or the Flesh's best. God's worst will turn it self into good,
<note place="margin">Exod. 3.3, 4.</note> as the Serpent, <hi>Moses</hi> was afraid of, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently turned into a Rod in his hand.</p>
                  <p>But the Devil's best turns to the greatest evil; <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> found it so:
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> He pleased them when he told them <hi>they should be as Gods,</hi> but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently saw <hi>they were naked.</hi> And so the World's <hi>best,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 1, &amp; 2.</note> when the heart is set upon the World, turns into <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit;</hi> so <hi>Solomon</hi> found it. And the <hi>best</hi> of self proves as bad. When <hi>Jonah</hi> would wave God's Call, and follow his own
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94446:49"/>humour, he learnt by sad experience, and dear bought, that <hi>they that observe lying vanities,</hi>

                  <p>First, Ignorance of God, of his worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; ignorance of his Allsufficiency, when men profess an unknown God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saw in <hi>Athens</hi> an Altar <hi>to the unknown God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 7.13. Ignoti nulla. cupido.</note> Now their spirits sit loose from God; they have no great affections for him, nor do they much stand in aw of him, but sin with liberty and liking;
<note place="margin">Jer. 9.3.</note>
                     <hi>They proceed from evil to evil; for they know not me, saith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mens ignorance of God's Attributes, and Word, and Works becomes sin to them,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 12.13.</note> as <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> did to <hi>Israel.</hi> And Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God becomes mens misery too, as is said of the people whom the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> placed in the Cities of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that <hi>because they knew not the manner of the God of the Land,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kings 17.26.</note>
                     <hi>therefore he sent Lions among them, and they slew them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they knew not the manner of the God of the Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unbelief is a sin that makes men to depart from God.
<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.12.</note>
                     <hi>Take heed Brethren, lest there be in any of you an heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3.19.</note> As Faith is the grace of union between God and Men, so Unbelief is the sin of separation.</p>

                  <p>It was self-righteousness that kept the Jews off from Christ, and the Scribes and Pharisees from sense of their sinfulness, and sorrow for it. Parts and moral Vertues, and a fair outward Carriage do often prove as great an impediment to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ, and the free Grace of God, as gross sins, and sometimes greater.

               <p>HAVING done with the two general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines from this first part of the Parable, I shall now proceed to those which result from the several Clauses thereof; beginning with that in the end of the 12th.

               <q>And he divided unto them his living.</q>
               <p>The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> That God gives men, even natural and sinful men, a portion, and leaves them to improve it.</p>
               <p>The Father gave his younger Son a portion, and left him to husband it. The wicked and slothful servant had a Talent put into his hands by his Lord:
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.15. Eph. 4.</note> Christ <hi>giveth gifts</hi> to men to improve, <hi>even to the rebellious,</hi> Psal. 68.18.</p>
               <p>The Heathen have their Talents: First, They have the light of Nature within them; they have a natural Divinity, whereby they know God, and much good and evil:
<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parts. Rom. 2.14, 15.</note> — <hi>having not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law:</hi> They have excusing and accusing Consciences.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, they have the light of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without them, by which they may feel after God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. — <hi>that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him.</hi> As we know the presence of the Soul in the Body by feeling the Pulse, so may, and so have the Heathens perceived God by their inspection into the Creation:
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> So saith the Apostle, <hi>The invisible things of him</hi> (i. e. of God) <hi>from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.</hi> But now to Christians, who live in the Climate of the Gospel, God gives another greater light than those of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Creature, <hi>scil.</hi> the light of the holy Scriptures, and the offers of Christ and Salvation by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94446:52"/>him; the convictions also, and motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: The Spirit of God strives with men long,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> though not always. Besides, the Scripture holds forth to Christians the example of Christ, and of former Saints.</p>
               <p>And the Spirit also works in many men gifts and common grace, in some more, in some less. <hi>Judas</hi> had gifts as well as the rest of the Disciples; so had those that <hi>prophecied in Christ's Name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7.22.</note>
                  <hi>and in his Name cast out Devils</hi>—.
<note place="margin">Prov. 7.16.</note> Every man hath a <hi>price</hi> put into his hand, <hi>even the fool.</hi> God gives the worst of men among us a Portion to improve, and leaves them to husband their Talents.</p>
               <p>And first, men themselves would have it so, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> as we see in this younger Son: Men love to have it so,
<note place="margin">Jer. 5.31.</note> as the Lord said of the Jews: Natural men think they can shift sufficiently for themselves; they are full of self-projects, and self-confidence withal: <hi>I will pull down my barns and build bigger;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12.16.</note>
                  <hi>and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease</hi> — Such self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Creatures were those <hi>Is.</hi> 56.12. <hi>To morrow shall be as this day, and more abundant.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> Many men can live in the World without God; this is their conceit.</p>
               <p>Yea, better men than these mentioned have been prone to self-conceit, and self-confidence; not only <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 20.22.</note> They asked Jesus to sit one at his right hand, and the other at his left— <hi>Jesus asked them, Are ye able to drink of the Cup that I shall drink of? They say unto him, we are able.</hi> But alas, as they knew not what they asked, so they knew not what they answered; for when Jesus Christ was to drink the Cup, these two Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples left him as well as the rest.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:94446:53"/>
               <p>We may see self-conceit in the very Nature of man, if we observe Children when they first find their feet, they phancy they can go of themselves, and venture, though they get falls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As men love to have it so, <hi>scil.</hi> that God should give them their Portions, and leave them to themselves to husband it; so God will have it so, and that for divers Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To justifie himself when he judgeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth men. God gives every man more than he useth well: We need not go to God's decree of Reprobation to justifie his damning men; we do not find that God will judge man by his decrees; he will not say, Thou art damned, because I reprobated thee, but because thou hast not lived up to thy light, nor improv'd thy talent, thy knowledge, thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thy opportunities, and many helps.</p>
               <p>God reaps not where he sows not,
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.24.</note> as foolish man is apt to charge him. Men will be damn'd for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using their Portion God hath given them: the light, the means, the mercies, the afflictions, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the examples God hath given and set before them to improve.</p>
               <p>God will not need to condemn the Heathen for not believing in Christ, negative unbelief; <hi>i. e.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief for want of means damns not; but they will be damned for misusing the light of Nature, and the light of the Creature, that would have taught them more of God and themselves than they would learn:
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20, 21.</note>
                  <hi>They are without excuse,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:94446:53"/>
               <p>Indeed evil and slothful Christians will be damned for not coming home to Christ, and for not walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Profession of Christ they have made, because they walk not in those Duties of Holiness the Gospel discovers to them: These men will be <hi>speechless</hi> at the Sentence of Damnation which the Lord Jesus will pass on them, as he was in <hi>Matthew</hi> 22.12. Their own Consciences cannot but concurr with Sentence of Judgment;
<note place="margin">Qui tacet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentire videtur.</note> they will be speechless; they will be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.11. self-judged and self-condemned. They will not chat at God then, as they often do now.
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.19, 20.</note>
                  <hi>Who hath resisted his will?</hi> Nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against God, or answerest against, or chattest with God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. God doth give all men, the worst of men, their Portion, or Talents to improve, to glorifie his free Grace, and that two ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In entertaining such as have abused their Stock put into their hands, as the Father did by his Prodigal Son, and as the Housholder did by those that came into his work but at the eleventh hour. Sins against light and goodness, when pardoned, are great illustrations of free Grace: That woman <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much</hi> when <hi>much was forgiven her.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> O when a <hi>Saul obtains mercy,</hi> after he hath been a <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and a persecutor,</hi> after he hath turned the edge of all his learning, parts, gifts, and interest against the <hi>Name</hi> of Jesus Christ, and so farr vitiated and debauched his Conscience, as to do all this under pretence of Conscience; as he himself said,
<note place="margin">Acts 26.9.</note>
                  <hi>I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus of Nazareth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:94446:54"/>
               <p>I say, for such a man, after such base abuse of his Talents, to be received to Grace and Mercy, <hi>But I obtained mercy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> this must needs exalt the free Grace of God in the hearts of such as have so abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Grace: For God might have said to such a man as to the wicked and slothful Servant, <hi>Cast ye him into outer darkness:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.30.</note> There is desert enough for it, but free Grace over-rules the Case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God does it, that he may glorifie his free Grace in a free choice of the objects of his Grace; for all men in themselves are alike indisposed to honour God with their Portion he gives them. As we are all alike by Nature <hi>the children of wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.3. Tit. 3.3.</note> so we are all by Nature <hi>foolish, and disobedient, serving divers lusts.</hi> All by Nature refuse and resist Grace. Now God takes whom he pleaseth out of their own hands and power into his, to be under his Discipline:
<note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> He made <hi>David</hi> to <hi>know wisdom in the hidden parts;</hi> but did not so by <hi>Saul, —Thou hast hid these things</hi> (saith our Lord Jesus to his Father,
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.75.</note> and that with thanks) <hi>from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to babes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13.11.</note> And <hi>to you it is given to know the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Question of the Apostle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth this, <hi>Who made thee to differ from another?</hi> Indeed if the Question be asked a <hi>Jesuit</hi> or <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant,</hi> he will Answer, <hi>I my self made me to differ;</hi> but it's a proud Answer: For it is plain, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle asked not this Question to puff up man, but to humble him, and to exalt God, as appeareth by the following Question; <hi>And what hast thou that thou didst not receive?</hi> and then, <hi>Why dost thou
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94446:54"/>glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</hi> It's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent St. <hi>Paul's</hi> scope was that which is the scope of the Gospel, to <hi>exclude boasting:</hi> It is likely that <hi>Paul</hi> directed his Question to those <hi>Theologi gloriae,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> used to call the vain-glorious and self-ascribing Preachers at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> who would seem to be some great ones, as <hi>Simon</hi> did in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>In the Creation all was a confused Chaos till the Spirit moved on the face of the Waters,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and then there was a distinction of Creatures: So all men by Nature are a confused mass, all in darkness, and disobedience, and abusers of our Portions, turning our Talents against God who gives them,
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.3, 4.</note> as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> made an Idol of the golden Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> which God had given them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She did not know,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>that I gave her Corn and Wine and Oyl,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 2.8.</note>
                  <hi>and multiplied her Silver and Gold which they prepared for Baal,</hi> or wherewith they made <hi>Baal.</hi> Such abusers are men of their Parts and Portions he gives them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he changes their hearts, and giveth them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spirit.
<note place="margin">Philemon 11.

                  <note place="margin">Colos. 4.9.</note> He became both a faithful Servant and a faithful Brother: So contrary are men in a state of Grace to what they were in their Natural state.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:94446:55"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But whence is this Change?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not of man himself, but of God: He that made the old Creature makes the new. It is not the spirit of man that produces Regeneration, but the Spirit of God;
<note place="margin">John 3.</note>
                  <hi>Except a man be born again of the Spirit</hi>—. All Converts to a state of Grace, are <hi>begotten</hi> and <hi>born of God: He that is begotten of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1.3. —</note> and <hi>born of God,</hi> are usual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions with St. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God gives men a Portion, and leaves them to husband it, that he may humble them in the sense and proof of their own weakness and impotency, and make them look for help from Grace: God will have men humbled, not only for sin, but also for their impotency to get Grace.</p>
               <p>There must be in men a double self-despair; one in regard of sin and guilt;
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note>
                  <hi>All the world must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God:</hi> And another in regard of self-impotency to get Grace when they feel they need it. Sense of sin will make a man seek Grace; and sense of impotency will make him seek it of God: Many have the first self-despair, but want the second; for though they are out of hope in regard of their sins, yet not as to their own conceited self-sufficiency to repent and turn to God.</p>
               <p>Here lieth the reason of many mens not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning from sin to God, their thoughts of their Can when they will.
<note place="margin">Josh. 24.19, 21</note>
                  <hi>Joshua</hi> told the people, <hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is an holy God:</hi> The people reply, <hi>Nay, but we will serve the Lord.</hi> Men commonly cheat themselves with self-conceit and considence in the power of their own wills.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:94446:55"/>
               <p>Alas, God must not only give men power to seek Grace, but power to accept of it when he gives it, and power to use it when they have it.
<note place="margin">Hos. 5.5.</note>
                  <hi>Ephraim</hi> had been brisk enough in self-dependence; <hi>his pride did testifie to his face:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 31.18.</note> yet at length <hi>Ephraim</hi> crieth out, <hi>Turn thou me, O Lord, and I shall be turned.</hi> You that have Grace know, that not only the gift of Grace, but the use of Grace also is of God: <hi>Work out your salvation with fear and trembling;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.12, 13.</note>
                  <hi>for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spirit of God must help godly mens <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in prayer, Rom.</hi> 8.26. teach them <hi>what to say</hi> when brought <hi>before Rulers for Christ his sake, Matth.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Thou hast wrought all our works for us, Isa.</hi> 26.12. If God did not do thus for his own people,
<note place="margin">2 Chro. 32.31.</note> they would manage a state of of grace but ill. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was left to himself but in one point, he miscarried sadly: And therefore it is not ordinary for God to leave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to themselves; he did <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> yet but in one single case, to find him matter of humbling in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he had had matter of glorying in God. And</p>
               <p>We all may see our own insufficiency in him,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5.</note> even in common actions; yea, to a good thought, we are like young Writers who must have their Hand and Pen guided, else they make bad Letters. Had not Jesus Christ prayed for <hi>Peter's</hi> faith,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.32.</note> it had fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and it's thus with every Grace and all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<note place="margin">John 15.5.</note> And therefore little Grace acted with great dependance on Christ, will do more than a greater measure of Grace, but less dependance on Christ's assistance.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:94446:56"/>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ascribes not only the dignity of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship to God, but all his actual service therein; <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note>
                  <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me:</hi> Not to the Grace of God in me, but with me: He refers the honour of the Case, not to inherent, but assisting Grace.</p>
               <p>This is the reason why men receive not Grace, because they trust to their own purposes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours above their allowance: And this is the reason why many, who have received Grace, do not increase and grow in Grace as some others do, because they live not dependingly enough on assisting Grace.</p>

               <p>My Brethren, there is nothing that any man hath but it is part of his Portion, and he must be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the management of it; his degree, his calling, his time, his strength, his weakness, his comforts, his crosses, his natural parts, his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gifts, his grace, his means of grace, his estate, his priviledges, his ways, his words, his thoughts, God takes notice of a man's thoughts, and how he

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7.</note> But alas, how many spend their stock upon their lusts; <hi>The lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eyes, or the pride of life?</hi> And of those that do not thus, how many let their gifts lie fallow, and do little or nothing for God with them? Others devote their Estates to their covetous hearts: This is for a Lamentation.</p>
               <p>Yea, where is the Christian that leaves all sin he might, and does all the good he might; that prays so much as he might, and walks by Faith as he might, and denieth himself so much as he might, and hath his conversation in Heaven so much as he might? We all need Christ to make up our Accounts to God, more than <hi>Onesimus</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi> to make up his to <hi>Philemon.</hi>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But where lies the power of improvement? Not in us;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5, 6.</note> it lies in the hand of God: <hi>We are not sufficient of our selves, as of our selves to think any thing;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3.35.</note>
                  <hi>all our sufficiency is of God.</hi> And the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given this power into the Son's hand; <hi>Without me,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true; but there is an open way for us to God by Christ; and an open way to Christ by his own offer; <hi>Come unto me</hi>—And St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Ye have not,</hi>

               <p>But now to those that lay this block in their own way, and make this Objection, either they make it of experience and proof, or else of meer cavil. If the former, if you have willed it, and laboured for it, and bemoan'd your selves in the want of it, then you have but one step to it; for if you are come to self-despair, through sense of impotency, now is the time of that Promise,
<note place="margin">Zach. 12.8. Isa. 40.29.</note>
                  <hi>The feeble shall be as David:</hi> and that, <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaseth strength.</hi> Do but now fix your eye on God, as the <hi>lame man</hi> did on <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 3.</note> and he'll bid you <hi>rise and walk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Saul went to seek his Father's Asses, and could not find them, he went to a Seer,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 9.</note> to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and had good speed: Why so when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get grace, or ask grace, or do duty of your selves, by your own strength, take hold on God, and welcome; <hi>Let him take hold on my strength.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 27.5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But if you make this Objection of Cavil, be it known to you, you mistake your selves; you'l miss of your excuse you phansie to your selves. He that had but one Talent had his Cavils; his Master was <hi>a hard Master,</hi> &amp;c. But did this excuse him?
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.24. &amp;c.</note> No.</p>
               <p>It is one thing to know your own impotency to get grace, or improve grace, only by hear-say; and another to know it by experience and trial. If you object it, when you know it only by hear-say from the Minister and the Word of God, it is but a Cavil and a sorry Excuse: It is your knowledge of it by trial and proof that will make you look out of your selves for your strength, and that will bring you in grace, with power to improve it. You should
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94446:59"/>work out your own Salvation with no less pains, than if your own pains should procure it.</p>
               <p>It is true, God gives the success; this is all in his hand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. But he gives success to him that labours for it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes not his inference thus; Because God hath all grace, and gives all, I'le do nothing;
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.12, 13.</note> but therefore do <hi>you work,</hi> because <hi>it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do.</hi> You must labour as much, as if to will and to do were in your own power: You must work that God may work.</p>
               <p>Many from their impotency father their sin and their condemnation for it on God; it is in way of Cavil, and not from their bewailed sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Nay, the truth is, it is common with natural men to think themselves abler than they are, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness their frequent resolutions in good moods; O what they will do and be!
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note> As those Heathens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed themselves to be wise, so do natural men; they sometimes profess their ability, and sometimes their impotency, but have little practical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of either.</p>
               <p>Some men again disable themselves beyond their natural disability; they weaken their natural power by their own wilfulness; and this is so farr from an excuse, as it's an aggravation of their sin. If a Master send his man to Market, and he is drunk, and so cannot do his business, will this disability excuse him? Surely no; it rather doubles his fault. This is the case of these Objectors of their impotency; their impotency is their own, they cannot charge it upon God; they may charge it in part upon <hi>Adam</hi> indeed; but when they come to declare their own
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94446:59"/>will, they make it their own impotency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 5.40.</note> They are impotent, and they love to have it so, as the Lord said of the Jews.
<note place="margin">Jer. 5.31.</note> They would not come to Christ, as he would have them, if they could. Thus much for answer to the Objection, and also for the use of Exhortation.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine may also put us all upon enquiry after direction in this case of infinite moment. <label type="milestone">

               <p>THE younger Son having got his Portion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hand, begins to act his part; first in sin, in this verse; secondly in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in the 14, 15, 16th verses; thirdly in repentance, in the 17th, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the two former he is the picture of all natural men; in the third but of some, yea of few. In acting his part in sin; first, he presently leaves his Father's house: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he goes into a farr Countrey: thirdly, there he spends all his Portion in luxury and riot.</p>
               <p>Now in this Prodigal Son there are represented to us many things in natural men of sad Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here we see how soon man leaves God, when God leaves man to himself; man makes hast to sin
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94446:61"/>against God. <hi>Not many days after the younger Son took his journey into a farr Countrey, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the temper and inclination of the rational Creature, they sin so soon as they can; and herein they appear to be irrational: We see this both in the Angelical and Human Nature. The Angels that were left to themselves sinned presently,
<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with left their first estate:

Hence it is said,

               <p>Some of the <hi>School-men</hi> hit right in this. <hi>A Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> saith <hi>Aquinas, though never so excellent and holy, may and will sin, if not prevented and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace.</hi> And this was the Answer St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> gave to the Question, How the Angels came to sin so soon, <hi>Quia non Deus sunt,</hi> because they are not God.

               <p>But many Angels changed their condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; <hi>The Devil sinneth from the beginning:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 3.8.</note> the Devil, that is, the Prince of the Angels that left their first estate. A space there was between their Creation and defection; First, that it might appear they came holy Angels out of God's hand: And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they might remember afterwards, and for ever, from whence they were fallen; as our Lord said to the Angel or Pastor of the Church of

<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 2 Cor. 11.3.</note> for man sinned by the instigation of the Devil.</p>

                  <head>Reasons of the Doctrine.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the corrupted nature of man is greedy of sin, <hi>They work all uncleanness with greediness:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.19.</note> They have a strong appetite to sin; the strength of appetite, as in the Hebrew,
<note place="margin">Isa. 56.1.</note> therefore called <hi>greedy dogs.</hi> Man sinned almost so soon as he was, and if he might, he would sin as long as he is, and would,
<note place="margin">Omnis pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor peccat in aeternum.</note> if he could, sin for ever, and be for ever that he might sin: How will men break through all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints to sin? as <hi>Balaam</hi> would have rush'd through all the checks and disappointments he met with in his way to curse <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though <hi>the dumb Ass forbad his madness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.16.</note> and the <hi>Angel stood in his way with a drawn sword</hi> to stop him,
<note place="margin">Num. 22.23 to 30.</note> yet he was violently hurried on with the strong impulse of his own lusts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>St. Ambrose</hi> speaks of one <hi>Theolimus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">On Luke 4.</note> who being told by his Physician, That unless he left his intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, he would lose his eyes: His heart was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately set on his lust, that he replied,
<note place="margin">Tunc vale lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note>
                     <hi>Then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well eyes; I must drink, though I drink out my eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus do the hearts of many say, though not their mouths, Farewell God, farewell Christ, farewell Heaven, I must have my lust. <hi>Amnon's</hi> lusting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Tamar</hi> is an instance in the case.
<note place="margin">Psal. 14.2.</note>
                     <hi>The fool hath said in his heart there is no God,</hi> i. e. O that there were no God! Look what trouble it is to Saints to part with God, such trouble it is to wicked men to part with sin. <hi>There is no hope,</hi> No;
<note place="margin">2 Jer. 25.</note> for <hi>I have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94446:63"/>loved strangers, and after them I will go.</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reason of mens sinning is their will: It was so in the fall, and so it is since.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A second Reason why men make so much haste to sin is their weakness; no man by nature hath strength enough to hold out against temptations to sin: If God were not infinite in strength, he would not be immutable;
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.29.</note>
                     <hi>The strength of</hi> Israel <hi>will not repent,</hi> or change. But the first temptation turned man upside down; and since the Devil had that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, he follows man close with temptations; and if he fails in one,
<note place="margin">Num. 22, &amp; 23.</note> he presently tries another, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did experiments to curse <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man is too weak a Creature to stand out a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to sin without the aid of grace, either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or assisting grace, besides inherent: It was seen in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and in <hi>Peter,</hi> when left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Grace it self, of it self, is not immutable. The godly know by experience that it is subject to ebbings and flowings; and the reason why the people of God do not quite lose grace, is not from the nature of grace in it self, but because grace in the Saints is fed by grace from the fulness of Christ;
<note place="margin">John 1.16. Jer. 32.40.</note> and because the Covenant of grace hath undertaken they shall not totally and finally fall from grace.</p>
                  <p>And again, grace is upheld in the godly by their communion with God, and therefore the more this communion is interrupted, the less grace, and the more sin Saints themselves have: Hence it is that when they come to live in the blessed vision of God in Heaven, they cease to sin, and there is no more capacity of sinning.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:94446:63"/>
                  <p>This is the reason why the elect Angels,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.21.</note> so called in Scripture, stood in their first estate; free grace preserved them in the beatifical vision, and still doth; And <hi>they always behold the face of my Father in Heaven,</hi> saith our blessed Saviour.
<note place="margin">Matth. 18.10.</note> O remember that man is by nature a weak Creature, and yet very wilfull, and would be independent on God,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> and so <hi>the Devil leads him captive at his will.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. This shews us the necessity and mercy of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and restraining grace; were it not for this, the World would be fuller of sin than it is, even like the old World; all places would be <hi>Sodoms,</hi> and the godly as <hi>Lots</hi> therein.
<note place="margin">Psal. 32.91.</note> But God makes wicked men chew upon the Bit; he seeth they have need of Bit and Bridle, as well as the Herse;

                  </p>
                  <p>If God had not restrained <hi>Balaam,</hi> he would have cursed <hi>Israel;</hi> he made many attempts after disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.

<note place="margin">Gen. 11.6, 7.</note> he confounded their language.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may be of use to humble us all, <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>And as this should humble us, that we begin so early to sin; so we have reason to be humbled, that usually we are so long before we are good: It is commonly many years before our Conversion to a state of grace: Some come not in to God till the <hi>sixth hour;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 20.</note> others not till <hi>the eleventh;</hi> O how should this humble late Converts, that they are good so little a space on earth? Some indeed <hi>give God the kindness of their youth;</hi>

                  </label> That it is a disposition in natural men to carry their gods in their goods; their hearts, which should be the seat and temple of God, is the habitation of these.</p>
               <p>This young man's Portion was his all,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.19. Job 31.24.</note> even his Heaven and his God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of some <hi>whose belly was their god:</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> of those <hi>whose gold was their god,</hi> being their hope and their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94446:66"/>confidence. Many men have their Portion in this life;
<note place="margin">Psal. 17.14.</note> their Heaven and Earth together.</p>
               <p>Every thing is a mans god that feeds his lust, and his heart is set upon, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> golden Calf was to them;
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.4.</note>
                  <hi>These are thy gods, O Israel</hi>— and as <hi>Micahs</hi> Mothers eleven hundred shekels of silver were turned into Gods.
<note place="margin">Judges 17.4.</note> And thus all natural men make gods of their lusts, or of their goods, on which they fix their hearts. They carry their gods in their goods,
<note place="margin">Gen. 31.34.</note> as <hi>Rachel</hi> hid her Father's Idols in the Stuff. It is natural to man to seek his felicity here.
<note place="margin">Psal. 17.14.</note> The Scripture calls them <hi>men of this world;</hi> here are their hearts, and here they would always be, if they might have their choice. They have a greater mind to be here,
<note place="margin">Luke 9.33.</note> than <hi>Peter</hi> had to be on Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their inward thought is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 49.11.</note> saith the Psalmist, <hi>that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This shews that their hearts are wholly here; their minds are given up to earthly things.
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> So they might be here on earth for ever, they could be content to be out of heaven;
<note place="margin">Gen. 25.31.</note> as <hi>Esau</hi> parted with his birthright for a mess of Pottage.</p>
               <p>Our blessed Saviour bad his Disciples <hi>rejoyce rather that their names were written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 10.20.</note>
                  <hi>than that the Devils were subject to them.</hi> But these men would rejoyce rather if their names might be written on Earth. Though the Scripture speaks of it as a Judgment;
<note place="margin">Jer. 17.13.</note>
                  <hi>They that depart from me shall be written in the earth:</hi> Yet earthly things lie nearest to a carnal man's heart; as it's said Queen <hi>Mary</hi> should say on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94446:66"/>her Death-bed, <hi>That if they saw her heart when dead, they should see</hi> Calice <hi>there.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> appetite or phancy was more after the Leeks,
<note place="margin">Numb. 11.5, 6.</note> and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Garlick of <hi>Egypt,</hi> than after Manna.</p>
               <p>Men are apt to set up Idols in their hearts, many places in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> shew it;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 14.3. Judges 5.8.</note> the children of <hi>Israel</hi> chose new gods. The Devil would be the god of this World; this is his <hi>name</hi> by usurpation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens hearts are devoted to him, and know it not; as it's said of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that he had gray hairs and knew it not: yea, he made an essay for Christ's heart and devotion to him. And when he cannot get in himself into the hearts of men, as he wishes, then he gets into one Creature or other to be as god there. When <hi>Esau</hi> said to <hi>Jacob, I have enough;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 33.9.</note> what was his enough? the fulness of his outward condition without God. Carnal men can be content with the World without God;
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> they <hi>are without God in the world.</hi> The Creature, in some sort, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies them without God, as it does the Beast.
<note place="margin">Psal. 49.20.</note> Man makes himself in this like the Beast. <hi>Esau</hi> neither saw, nor sought God in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s face, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did in his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.10.
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.25. Lam. 3.24.</note> Men naturally affect the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more than the Creator. Indeed, if a godly man have not God for his Portion, his all he hath is nothing: <hi>The Lord is my portion, saith my soul:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 73.25.</note> and, <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none on earth that I desire besides thee.</hi> The Lord knows indeed that his Saints on earth have need of earthly things,
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.32.</note> as our blessed Saviour said to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And therefore gives them of these more or less, as he sees meet; yet whatever he gives them of the World, he so gives it, that they may see him in it, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did in <hi>Esau</hi>'s face.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94446:67"/>
               <p>O take heed of thinking you have enough, when you have the most of this world, except you have God with it, and see God in it. Take heed of this young man's spirit; when he had got his Portion, he now feels no want of his Father, but takes his journey into a farr Countrey.

               <head type="sub">And took his journey into a far Countrey.</head>
               <p>IN this course of the Prodigal, who herein is the Representative, as it were, of natural men, we may observe two Doctrines; the first (whereof in this Chapter) is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> That man by nature would go farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God; he would get to the utmost point of distance from him.</p>
               <p>This Prodigal did not only leave his Father's House, but went into a far Countrey.
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.27.</note> Ungodly men love to be far from God, that they may sin their fill. As a godly man goes from grace to grace, so an ungodly man from sin to sin. As it is their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do so; <hi>Add iniquity to their iniquity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 69.27. Jer. 9.3.</note> so it is their choice; <hi>They go from evil to evil.</hi> The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:94446:68"/>before their Conversion,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> were <hi>afar of, and without God in the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> When <hi>Adam</hi> was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from his innocency, he got as far from God as he could.
<note place="margin">Psal. 10.4.</note> Natural men shove God out of their thoughts as much as they can.</p>
               <p>It is true, all natural men are not at an equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from God actually, though all are by nature inclined to be at the farthest point: There are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in a natural state, as there are in a spiritual. Our Lord Jesus told him that answered him so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
<note place="margin">Mark 12.34.</note> That <hi>he was not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> Some men are utter strangers to Christ; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are bordering on Conversion; yet still in their natural state; as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were at the borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when yet they entred not in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what is the nearest or least point of distance from Christ, in a natural condition; and what is the farthest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> When men like Christ, but not at his terms, yet are troubled the terms are so hard that they cannot yield to them: When Jesus told that man in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. That <hi>he must sell all, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him,</hi> it is said the man was sad at that saying, <hi>and went away grieved</hi> — <hi>v.</hi> 22. This man was bordering upon Christ, but left him.</p>
               <p>So when men make a profession of Christ,
<note place="margin">John 2.23, 24.</note> and yet their hearts are not right towards him; they are near Christ, but not near enough, they are not in him: <hi>Many believed on his Name, but Jesus did not commit himself unto them, for he knew what was in man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art near in their mouths,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 12.2. Isa. 29.13.</note>
                  <hi>and far from their reins,</hi> saith <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to the Lord. And again, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men may be near God, as in profession, so in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94446:68"/>priviledges: <hi>Judas</hi> was one of Christ's Disciples, one of the Twelve: And the people of <hi>Israel</hi> were <hi>a people near unto God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 148.14.</note> This is the nearest point of distance from God.</p>
               <p>But then secondly for the farthest point of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and this is, when men live as it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world;
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> live in sin without sense of it, and sin with greediness; it is meat and drink to them to sin,
<note place="margin">John 4.34.</note> as it was to Jesus Christ to do his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's will; <hi>They drink iniquity like water,</hi> Job 15.16. <hi>and who being past feeling;</hi> whose sense of feeling, as to any evil in sin, is gone; <hi>They give themseves over to work wickedness:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 22.20</note>
                  <hi>Ahab sold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> but some <hi>give</hi> themselves <hi>to sin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.19.</note> These are Candidates at least in Atheism.
<note place="margin">Psal. 94.5.</note>
                  <hi>They say the Lord shall not see:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 50.21. Psal. 36.2. Psal. 14.1.</note> And they think <hi>that God is such an one as themselves:</hi> and thus they flatter themselves in their own eyes; they half think there is no God, and altogether wish it. Few men indeed are always or altogether Atheists: The Devil can never be an Atheist, being always under the sense of God's wrath; but he tempts men to be Atheists, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails very far, yet not to the full.</p>
               <p>They lie, saith the Philosopher,
<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> that say they hold there is no God; for though they say so to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by day, yet they say otherwise to themselves by night: these are the men that keep at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest point of distance from God, which was this Prodigals case; he went from his Fathers House <hi>into a far Countrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can any man be far from God, since God is every where?
<note place="margin">Psal. 139 7.</note>
                  <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?</hi> And it's said in <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 34.22.</note>
                  <hi>There is no darkness
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94446:69"/>where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</hi> And saith the Apostle,
<note place="margin">Acts 17.27.</note>
                  <hi>God is not far from every one of us,</hi> either Christians or Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a three-fold distance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of place; so no man can be at a distance from God;
<note place="margin">Psal. 139.8.</note>
                  <hi>If I ascend into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a distance of nature, which is where there are opposite natures and dispositions: and so many, if not most men, are at a great distance from God; there is nothing of the Divine nature in them, they have different minds and wills from God's. God wills this or that; and they will the contrary. Many men make God's affirmative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands negative, and his negative Commands affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi> told those Jews in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16. that they should not go into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and they replied, <hi>As to the words of the Lord thou hast spoken to us, we will not hearken to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a distance as to grace and favour; and so God may be said to be far from men in his special grace; as when men have not the grace of God in them, nor the love of God, nor acquaintance and communion with God; God may be said to be far from them.</p>
               <p>The presence of God with men must be measured by his grace and spirit in them; and not by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours, as riches, power, natural parts, means of grace,
<note place="margin">Psal. 17.17.</note> yea common grace: for heathens may have some of these, and hypocrites may have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet both at a distance from God, as to saving grace; God cannot say of them as of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 41.8.</note>
                  <hi>Abraham my friend,</hi> my familiar. A blind
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94446:69"/>man may be near the Sun, and yet be said to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, because he wants the light of it; so it is with many men who live in the light of the Gospel, and yet are far from God as to any saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him in Christ. A man may be your next Neighbour, and yet be as far from kindred, as the farthest in the Town.</p>
               <p>The Lord judges men near to him, or afar off, by their hearts;
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.12.</note>
                  <hi>Take heed lest there be in any of you an heart of unbelief to depart from the living God.</hi> An Hypocrite may be nearer God's people in outside similitude, than a Publican. As a painted Pot on the wall is nearer a Pot in outward similitude than a piece of Clay under your feet, and yet in fitness the Clay is nearer, because it is apter to be made a Pot; so an humble Publican and Sinner is nearer coming into the Kingdom of God than a proud Pharisee or Hypocrite, because his heart is more tender, and humbled under the sense of sin and wrath:
<note place="margin">Mark 21.31.</note>
                  <hi>The Publicans and the Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reason of mens going from God as far as they can, <hi>i. e.</hi> by nature, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>
                  </label> is the enmity that is in man's sinful nature to God; though God become nigh to our nature in his Sons assuming of it, yet naturally we keep at the greatest distance from his nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> from his holiness and purity:
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note>
                  <hi>The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity against God; it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Greek word signifies the best of a natural man is cross to God;
<note place="margin">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> the more wisdom and wit a natural man hath, the more crosly he acts towards God. This enmity in man to God came in with his fall from God: Before <hi>Adam</hi> hid not himself
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94446:70"/>from God, but was the friend of God by nature; his first nature, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was by grace; he could lean on God's bosome as the beloved Disciple did on Jesus;
<note place="margin">James 2.23.</note>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4. Gen. 1.</note> he had the rays of the Divine nature in him, as men in a state of grace have; God made him to his own likeness, but when he fell from his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, his enmity against God came in.</p>
               <p>A natural man cannot subject himself to the will of God, nor does he love the likeness of God; he is a lover of his own lusts more than of God.

                  <p n="1">1. This is useful to examination, to try our selves, whether we be near God, or gone far from him: And trial in this case is of great concernment to us; for we may be near to God outwardly, and in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of him, yet inwardly be at a distance from him; as those Jews were in <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple draw near me with their mouths, and with their lips honour me, but have removed their heart far from me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3.12.</note> We must estimate our nearness to, or distance from God, by our hearts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is God great or small, high or low, in our hearts account, in himself, and his word, and his works, especially as he is a holy God? If God be not much in our thoughts,
<note place="margin">Psal. 104.34.</note> and dear in our thoughts,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94446:70"/>as to <hi>David,</hi> it's a sign that we are far from God. Out of mind out of sight. What's the reason that the Stars seem so little to us, that are such great Bodies in themselves, but because they are at a great distance from us, and we from them? so God is a great God, <hi>glorious in holiness, fearful in praises;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 15. Psal. 63.3.</note>
                     <hi>his loving kindness better than life it self.</hi> And if he be not so in our thoughts, and to our hearts, it argues we are far from him; for were we nigh him, the pleasures, the profits, the honours of the world would be but trifles to us; these would be far from our hearts if God was near them. <hi>I have rejoyced in the way of thy testimonies as much,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 119.127.</note> and doubtless <hi>more, than in all riches: I love thy Commandments above gold, yea above fine gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may know our distance from God by the chilness and coldness of our minds and affections in his service and ways. As in Winter, when we are at a farther distance from the Sun, days art short, and nights long, we are cold, and it is a dead season with all things: Why so when we are dull and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted in holy imployments, and walk dully as to acts of grace and comfort, it signifies that we are at a distance from God, and he from us, as to his gracious and quickning presence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men may be known to be far from God by their secure sinning, and sinning without sense. The holy Apostle gives three signs of men that are greatly remote from God, and they are desperate signs.
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.18, 15.</note> 1. Their gross ignorance of God: 2. Their sinning without feeling: 3. Their sinning with greediness: <hi>Having their understanding darkened, being alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94446:71"/>hearts, who being past feeling, have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When men sin with greediness, it's a sign they are past feeling, and when they are past feeling, it's a sign they know not God, and this is a sign, they are alienated from the life of God, and so are at the greatest point of distance from him.</p>

<note place="margin">Numb. 20.8. Psal. 105.31.</note> concerning the Jews; so may it also imply, that the whole Creation, even of sensless Creatures, are (as I may say) more obedient to God than natural men are.</p>

                  <hi>Willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94446:72"/>at Christs; their morals fill them with self-esteem, to think of themselves as that Pharisee said of himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men, or even as this Publican; I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess.</hi>

                  <head>Reasons of the Point</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Now this comes to pass from the exceeding sinfulness of sin in men,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.13.</note> insomuch as sin by the Commandment becomes exceeding sinful; sin was more exasperated by the Commandment which was to restrain it. Some men are of such a strange constitution, that their Physick works quite contrary to the Physicians meaning; as it is a saying, That the Bee sucks honey, but the <hi>Spider poison</hi> out of sweet Herbs. O the vile and base na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sin!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because men are prone to ascribe to themselves the good things they receive from God: <hi>They said not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 2.6.</note>
                     <hi>where is the Lord that brought us up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. Men attribute that to their own power or parts, which belongs to God. This the Lord knew, when he would not let <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> beat and conquer the <hi>Midianites</hi> with a great force;
<note place="margin">Judges 7.2.</note>
                     <hi>Lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And saith the Lord to the same people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.12, 14, 17. <hi>Beware lest when thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c. And then say in thine heart, My power, and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.</hi>

                  <head>Application of the Point.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. This tells us how little reason there is to exalt and magnifie the nature of man, and man's naturals in order to grace, as some men do. For man by nature is a most disingenuous Creature; he is prone to be worse towards God, by all the good that God does him. What the Lord said to <hi>Israel,</hi> he may say to all natural men very often, <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 32.6.</note>
                     <hi>O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the ill requital; God was <hi>their Lord, their Father, their Maker, their Redeemer, their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisher:</hi> And <hi>Israel</hi> was <hi>foolish, unwise, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, perverse, and crooked.</hi> So that there is more reason to debase, than exalt the nature of man, in his behaviour towards God and his grace. A disingenuous nature in man towards man sounds harsh;
<note place="margin">Isa. 5.4.</note> much more towards God. <hi>What could I have done more for my Vineyard that I have not done? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? They tempted God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 106.7.</note>
                     <hi>and provoked him at the Sea, even at the red Sea;</hi> where he wonderfully delivered them.</p>
                  <p>A natural man is an unthankful Creature to God; this is one of his black marks,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.2.</note>
                     <hi>unthankful.</hi> This is his manner from his youth; he treads in the steps of unkind <hi>Israel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.18, 19.</note>
                     <hi>I brought up</hi> Israel <hi>out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94446:74"/>and out of the hand of all Kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you: And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, and your tribulations; yet ye have this day rejected your God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is said of <hi>Amazia,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.14. That after God had given him a great victory over the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> he brought their gods, and set them up to be his gods: A strange and sad requital of the strength which the Lord had lent him to conquer his enemies. And of <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> his Son it is said, That when God had marvellously helped him, till he was strong,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 26.15, 16.</note>
                     <hi>then his heart was lifted up, and he transgressed against the Lord his God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This bespeaks you all to observe and try your own spirits in this point. O if you, or any of you find upon observation, the goodness of God obliging to your hearts, and that you use to dedicate your Mercies to God, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did her Son;
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. Rom. 12.1.</note> and your selves as well as your mercies, this is a good sign. Do you lay your selves below your mercies,
<note place="margin">Gen. 32.10.</note> as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did? <hi>I am less than the least of all thy mercies thou hast shewed unto thy servant:</hi> And do you set God above your mercies, and above your selves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so? <hi>Let him do unto me what seemeth good unto him,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. And do you use to admire God when you see how mindful he is of you? saying in your hearts as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who am I, O Lord God? or what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</hi> Now you may conclude that you have more than meer nature in you, that you have grace, which is of the Divine Nature, which begins to exert it self here, in the everlasting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment you shall have in heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:94446:75"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet because you are not all spirit and grace here, but have sinful flesh, and <hi>the flesh lusting against the spirit;</hi> therefore beware of the leaven of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men, in turning God's goodness to you against him.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.1.</note> Spiritual men may be carnal in some things: So good a man as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> may pride it after fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous deliverances:
<note place="margin">2 Chro. 32.25.</note> And so holy a man as <hi>Paul</hi> may, if not prevented,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> be <hi>exalted above measure, after the abundance of revelations.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 30.</note> And <hi>David</hi> may wax wanton and secure, when God hath <hi>made his mountain strong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O take heed, Christians; if your Portion here make you proud, because it is great, or discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed because it is little, as you think it, be sure you shall come under Providences to humble you, and bring you to your selves. O let grace watch the corruption of nature,
<note place="margin">James 4.6.</note> and use its power over it; for God giveth more grace, grace that is too strong for the corruption of nature; but if good days carry you from God, be sure that evil days shall bring you back.</p>

               <p>He spoils all that goes through his hands; he <hi>pollutes</hi> the holy things of God, as those Jews did <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. He ordinarily takes the name of God <hi>in vain</hi> by his carnal, careless, customary performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

<note place="margin">James 4.3. 1 John 2.16.</note> these he <hi>consumes upon his lusts; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judges 10.6.</note> As the Gentile Nations had their several gods, so have natural men their several lusts; one pleasure, another pride, another covetousness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother intemperance, &amp;c. Corruption of nature in natural men breaks out several ways in several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as corruption of the blood and humours of the body, break forth in one disease in one man, and in another disease in another. All natural men have their particular lusts, on which they spend their Father's substance.</p>
               <p>They are all like <hi>Onesimus</hi> before his Conversion,

                  <hi>unprofitable; They are together become unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or rotten, as the Greek imports, and so good for nothing, as we say of a rotten Apple.

                  <note place="margin">Nahum 2.10. Zach. 7.5.</note> but empty, and void, and waste: or if he did any good, it was to himself, and not to God.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:94446:76"/>
               <p>Other Creatures are more usefull to man than natural men are to God:
<note place="margin">Isa. 1.3.</note>
                  <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Ass his Master's crib, but</hi> Israel <hi>doth not know— Balaam</hi>'s Ass was more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God, than <hi>Balaam</hi> himself;
<note place="margin">Numb. 6.22.</note> what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he did, he did it by force,

<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, God may, and doth make use of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al men sometimes in some special service: As he made use of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to do his good pleasure, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing the Jews,
<note place="margin">Isa. 44.28.</note> and <hi>returning them into their own Countrey,</hi> and in their <hi>laying the foundation of the Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> did the Lord a great peice of service against <hi>Tyrus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 29.18, 19.20.</note> and he gave him <hi>Egypt</hi> for his hire: But alas, he intended no such thing as to do God service in the case, but satisfied his own <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and lust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Assyrian</hi> was <hi>the rod of God's anger</hi> to punish his sinning people;
<note place="margin">Isa. 10.7.</note>
                  <hi>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so, but it is in his heart to destroy,</hi> to serve his own pride and cruelty, and not the will of God. <hi>Zenacherib</hi> indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the service of God, when he came up against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Judah;</hi>

                  <hi>Am I come up without the Lord against this Land to destroy it?

               <p>All the actions of natural men are from self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principles, and to self-ends; and the service they do God,

Now when branches are cut off from the Tree, they wither, and bear no fruit. Since the fall all men by nature are separated from God, which was signified by <hi>Adam</hi>'s being thrust out of Paradise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. so that now men by nature are like the fruitless Fig-tree which Jesus cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.19.</note> or they are that <hi>wild Olive-tree</hi> spoken of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17.

<note place="margin">Job 19.</note> but <hi>the root of the matter</hi> is not in them, as <hi>Job</hi>'s phrase is; that is, true grace, or the grace of sincerity.</p>
               <p>As when the earth lost its blessing it was under at first,

               <p>I Have done with the first Doctrine from this last Clause of the 13. Verse, <hi>viz. That a natural man is an unprofitable and unserviceable Creature to God.</hi> I proceed to a second from the same words, which is this, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94446:79"/>natural man is wise for himself;
<note place="margin">Prov. 9.12.</note> he may be wise in his time, as the World counts wisdom. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith,
<note place="margin">Luke 16.8.</note>
                  <hi>The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light; i. e.</hi> in their contrivances for the things of this world.</p>
               <p>But this is wisdom from beneath, such as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is, and teacheth: For indeed no man is truly wise for himself, who is not wise and a forecaster for eternity;
<note place="margin">Mark 8.36.</note>
                  <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and to lose his own soul?</hi> And as are his profits,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.25.</note> such are his pleasures; <hi>the pleasures of sin for a season:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 2.26.</note> They will be <hi>bitterness in the end,</hi> as <hi>Joab</hi> said of the Sword.</p>
               <p>Whatever natural men possess, health or wealth, or parts, or power, yea, or means of grace, they use them not to their true advantage in the end: When their accounts are cast up, it will be found that all is wasted, they have laid up nothing for their eternal comfort, but die infinitely in God's debt: and unless mercy and free grace forgive them and God put their debt on Christ's account, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Onesimus</hi> his,
<note place="margin">Philem.</note> on his own, they must lie in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for ever. Every man that dies in his natural state,
<note place="margin">John 8.</note>
                  <hi>dieth in his sins;</hi> he dieth <hi>poor, and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>

                  <hi>and naked:</hi> as our first Parents when they had sinned,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> they saw themselves naked within as well as without; they saw a strange sight of themselves; they were afraid of themselves, as well as of God; they were <hi>Magor-missabib,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 20.</note> as <hi>Pashur</hi> was, <hi>a terrour to themselves;</hi> so will all natural men be, dying such.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They labour in the fire;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mos. 12.1.</note> they sow folly, and reap misery; they feed upon the wind, and at length the Lord speaks to them out of the whirl-wind;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94446:79"/>
                  <hi>They shall eat of the fruit of their own way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.31.</note>
                  <hi>and be filled with their own devices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those of them that make a fair shew in the world,
<note place="margin">Numb. 11.20. Psal. 106.15.</note> their glut of these worldly things will prove a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furfeit to them, as <hi>Israels</hi> fill of flesh did to them. Death is in the pot of every natural man; and all their plenty and pleasure here will in the end be like that <hi>Manna</hi> which the <hi>Israelites</hi> kept till morning,
<note place="margin">Exod. 16.20.</note> which rotted and stank.</p>
               <div type="reason">
                  <head>Reason of the Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>Now the Reason why natural men are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures to themselves is, because their selves, and the satisfying of their lusts, is the beginning and end of all their seekings and gettings. What God gives them, they use not to him, but to themselves, to feed their pride, or covetousness, or intemperance, or revenge: Some lusts or other are fed with all they have.</p>
                  <p>As whatever a man or woman eats that hath an Ulcer or Cancer in their bodies, feeds those sores; so does a natural man's estate, power, pleasure, yea his profession of Religion, all feed his lusts.</p>
                  <p>Natural mens lusts are their rule and their end; they <hi>fashion themselves according to their lusts.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.14. Judges 17.6.</note> It is natural to men to do <hi>that which is good in their own sight.</hi> Nothing will be restrained from them that they have imagined,
<note place="margin">Gen. 11.6.</note> as the Lord said of the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> if they may have their own wills. They say as <hi>Pharaoh, Our lusts shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, Exod.</hi> 15.9.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:94446:80"/>
                  <p>Now when a man's own lusts are his rule and his end in all, God will curse and blast all his works and ways in the end;
<note place="margin">Isa. 42.8.</note> he will not give his glory to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor his will neither. Therefore did not the Lord make any account of the Jews their seventy years fasting in Captivity,
<note place="margin">Zach. 7.5.</note> because they fasted not to him, but to themselves. This Prodigal in the Text was all for himself, and his own lusts, nothing for his Father, or his Father's house; he was for a far Countrey, and there he wasted and consumed all.</p>
                  <p>At first man would have had a parity with God, <hi>ye shall be as gods</hi>— O this took much with them.
<note place="margin">Isa. 14.13.</note> This was <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s language, <hi>I will be like the most high.</hi> It is spoken of the Babylonian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; yea, man hath pride enough in his nature to prefer himself above God, to think himself wiser than God,
<note place="margin">Alphonsus.</note> and juster than God. As a King of <hi>Spain</hi> said, as History tells us, <hi>That if he had been at the Creation, he could have ordered some things bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How did <hi>Sennacharib</hi> exalt himself above the Lord! <hi>Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 36.20.</note>
                     <hi>that the Lord should deliver</hi> Jerusalem <hi>out of my hand?</hi> He thought himself of more might than the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Thus is man by nature great in his own eye, and his own way good, yea the best; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is so good a friend to himself, as to undo himself;
<note place="margin">Jer. 4.18.</note>
                     <hi>Thy way and thy doings have procured thee these things.</hi>

                  <head>Application.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. This shews us the sad Condition of meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, in that their wit, and wealth, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and all their contrivances dwindle away into vanity, as fire doth into smoke; as that rich fool's Barns did, when it was said unto him, <hi>Thou fool,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 12.20.</note>
                     <hi>this night shall thy soul be required of thee.</hi> They find at the end, that their accounts fall altogether short of their expectations; their disappointments amaze them, like theirs <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ye have sown much, and brought in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.</hi> Poor natural man, he chooses his own ways, but to his own confusion: As <hi>Saul</hi> said to his son <hi>Jonathan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.30.</note>
                     <hi>Thou hast chosen the son of</hi> Jesse <hi>to thine own confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> At last, if his condition change not, he will say of all his possessions, and parts, and projects, and pleasures, as <hi>Haman</hi> did of all his,
<note place="margin">Esth. 5.13.</note>
                     <hi>All this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth me nothing.</hi> All falls into a little gelly, as Star-like Meteors in the Air do. So unprofitable a Creature is a natural man to himself; he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true riches, and so hath cheated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a meer phantasm of happiness, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost calls <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s and his Queens great pomp in which they came into the Court,
<note place="margin">Acts 25.23.</note> they entred <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>with great phancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:94446:81"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Learn we hence, what a destructive thing it is to men to walk in their own ways, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their lusts the rule and end of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. This young man had much ruined himself this way. It was God's heavy Judgment on the world of the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Acts 14.16.</note> when he suffered them to walk in their own ways: and it was the like Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Jews,
<note place="margin">Psal. 81.12.</note> when <hi>he gave them up to their own hearts lust,</hi> and <hi>they walked in their own counsels.</hi> This self-will and self-endednes is the plague of most mens hearts, even in these last days. —<hi>Men shall be lovers of their own selves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.2, 4.</note> and <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of pleasure,</hi> or their own lust, <hi>more than of God.</hi> O this self in our actions natural, civil, or religious, consumes all our good: It is to mens most specious conversations and accomplishments, as the worm was to <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, withers all.</p>
                  <p>There may be leaves, but no fruit, when gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time comes. This is the reason why many, when they come to die, have so little comfort, yea so much discouragement in the reflections they make on their lives.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore in the third place, this point serves to Instruction. If you would be wise for your selves, and reap profit and comfort from your ways, keep corrupt self out of doors; else all the good you think you do for your selves will be your death, as that part of <hi>Annanias</hi> his goods he kept back from the Church was his.
<note place="margin">Acts 5.5.</note> O learn and labour to have God in your eye, and to interest him above your selves in all your ways and undertakings, and then you'l make something of them; you will be sure to have your share in the fruit. Nothing will be lost this way, no not that which may seem to be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94446:81"/>lost; <hi>He that loseth his life for my sake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 10.39.</note>
                     <hi>shall find it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We count what we lay out in Land is not wasted, we shall have comings in by it; but what men or women lay out in intemperance in Meat, and Drink, and Apparel, that vanisheth into nothing, or worse. Thus so much of our time, and gifts, and estate we lay out for, and to God, will be as Land and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to us; we shall have our comings in that will exceed our layings out: But all we lay out on our lusts, it is consumed;
<note place="margin">James 4.3.</note> and all we lay out meerly for self-ends, is all waste. There may be the profits and <hi>pleasures of sin for a season,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. but in the end we shall meet with the sting of the Bee; and all, like <hi>Moses</hi>'s Rod, will turn into a Serpent. And</p>
                  <p>Condsider first, If your selves be your rule and end in your ways, you are not for God's use, and so he'l lay you aside; he will esteem you as broken Vessels, wherein is no pleasure, as he did <hi>Coniah;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 22.28.</note>
                     <hi>The Lord sets apart the man that is godly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> The man that will eye God,
<note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note> and concern God in all he does, this is <hi>a man after God's heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 23.22.</note> as <hi>David</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>If a Vessel into which you put Bear, sours or distasts it, you'l lay it by till it be sweeter, and use another. Why did God repent that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King?
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> because he saw he was for himself in his ways and actions, and not for God. Yea,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. While men make themselves their rule and their ends in their actions, in their particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or Profession of Religion, they set themselves in God's room; and how will God take this? We see how God took our first Parents attempting to be as gods.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94446:82"/>
                  <p>God may make one man to be instead of God to another in some sense,
<note place="margin">Exod. 4.16.</note> as he made <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Aaron;</hi> but no man may be instead of God to himself, which he is, while his own will is his rule, and himself is the chief end of his works and ways.</p>
                  <p>All God's own actions are for himself, because there is none above himself,
<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> or like himself. God's holiness and righteousness lies much in willing his own glory; for he should do himself wrong if he should give it to another,
<note place="margin">Isa. 42.8.</note> there being none besides himself capable of it. And so our holiness and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness lies much in improving all we are or have to and for God chiefly; none of our actions may terminate in any created being; they may not fall short of God and his glory,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> as their main scope. As <hi>Joab</hi> would have <hi>David,</hi> and not himself to have the honour of taking <hi>Rabbah:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> so should we do by God; He is all in all in heaven, and so he should be on earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The meanest of actions that have God for their bias and mark, hereby become glorious actions; and as mean as they be to the eye of the world, if it be but <hi>the giving a cup of cold water</hi>— Christ will have as great care such actions shall not be lost, as he had of the fragments of the miraculous bread and fish with which he fed many thousands;
<note place="margin">Matth. 14.</note> he would have all gathered up, and none lost. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven is the fruit the meanest actions bear which are thus terminated: They are more glorious things in the eye of God than an Angel's tongue,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1.</note> or a faith of Miracles. These are actions that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Agents to heaven; such actions and works as are wrought in God, and for God, will follow a man to God;
<note place="margin">Rev. 14.13.</note>
                     <hi>his works shall follow him:</hi> They do
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94446:82"/>not go before him, to make way for him; Christ's works alone have this honour: but they shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow him, and <hi>be to praise, and honour, and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ;</hi> as St.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.7.</note>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> saith of the faith of Saints.</p>
                  <p>The Reason why I am so large on this matter is, because a man's dedicating his ways and works to his own will and end, is the reason, as you have seen, why natural men are so unprofitable Creatures to themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi>

                     </label> But how shall we know whether God or our selves be our main rule and end in all our ways and actions?</p>

                     </label> Observe what it is that puts you upon good actions, and that sweetens your labour and pains therein: If your own credit, or profit, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward self-advantages, then your selves are your main end, and not God: But if the will of God, and glory of God, pleasing of God, and injoying of God bear sway, and be the wings that carry you on; not your selves, but God is your supream end: As the pains that the people took in <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. in going from all parts of the Land to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was to <hi>meet God in Zion.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Observe where you mostly look for reward in your religious and good works. If from men, you are your own ends: if from God, God is your end, especially if you look at God himself for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<note place="margin">Gen. 15.2.</note> The Nurse looks not for a reward of her care from the Child, but the Mother: And so when you look for your reward from God, and not men, you quit your selves from the Spirit of an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pharisee, and have an argument for your since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that God is your mark and motive.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Observe what it is wherein thy heart resteth it self in thy passage through this world: If it be for that thou hast estate enough, or repute with men enough, or a sufficiency of other flesh-pleasing circumstances, it is a sign thou art thine own end; like that rich man in the Gospel,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> who sang to himself, Soul, take thine ease, thou hast much goods laid up for many years: but if thou hast no hearts ease longer than thou hast God's presence, or restest upon him, and art laying out thy self in his service, and for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thou maist reckon upon it that God is thy great end. This was the great content of Christ's heart, <hi>That he did always the things that pleased his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8.29. John 17.4.</note> and, <hi>Father, I have glorified thee on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord Jesus,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.4.</note> even as the Son of man, was much better than the Angels; yet not his own, but his Fathers will was his rule, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. and his Fathers glory his high end;

                     <hi>What shall I say? Save me from this hour. Father, glorifie thy Name.</hi> This was the comfort of Jesus Christ, when he went out of this world; <hi>Father, I have glorified thee on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my Brethren, this is one of the greatest points in religion, to look what is your great end in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in all your conversation in this World, your selves or God: if your selves, you will have a blast on all you do; do you never so much, you do but waste your Substance your Father hath given you,
<note place="margin">Isa. 55.2.</note> as this younger Son did; <hi>You labour for that which satisfieth not.</hi> But if God be your motive and your end, you may be sure you labour not in vain, nor spend your strength for nought, for <hi>your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is with the Lord,</hi>

                  <p>Here is the excellency of grace, that it lifts up your eyes much to God: as it's the excellency of man's body above that of other living Creatures, in being made erect; his own figure teaching him to lift his eyes and thoughts up to heaven.

                  <hi>Sheweth, that when men forsake God, he gives them up to the height of sinning; from the same Clause,</hi> And there wasted his Substance with riotous living.</head>
               <p>THERE is yet a third Doctrine from this last Clause of the Thirteenth Verse, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> That when men depart from God, and cast off his fear and counsel, then he gives them up to the height of sinning. When this younger Brother got from under his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's eye into a far Countrey, there he lived in all excess of riot; he lived riotously. And what a life that is,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4 3, 4.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us; a living in <hi>lasciviousness, lust, excess of wine, revellings, &amp;c.</hi> This was the case of the Jews, when they hearkened not to the Lord's voice,
<note place="margin">Psal. 81.11, 12.</note> and would have none of him, he then <hi>gave them up to their own hearts lust</hi>—</p>
               <p>We see the case also exemplified in the Gentiles, when they regarded not God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24, 26, 28.</note> nor liked to retain
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94446:84"/>him in their knowledge, he gave them up <hi>to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> through the lusts of their own hearts, and <hi>unto vile affections,</hi> and <hi>unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.</hi> As <hi>Ahab sold himself to work wickedness,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. And others gave themselves over to lasciviousness,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.19.</note> to work all uncleanness with greediness, being <hi>led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the Devil at his will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And such men are within a few steps of the state of the Devils, because they sin wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and greedily: There is not only their will in their sinning, but wilfulness and obstinacy.
<note place="margin">Jer. 44.16, 17.</note>
                  <hi>As for the word thou hast spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouths.</hi> It's true, that not only natural men, but such who have grace, do sin; but not such sins as these sin, nor any sins in such a manner. A godly man may sin a great and gross sin,
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.2.</note> but he is tempted to it, and overtaken with it. It was <hi>Satan</hi> that <hi>provoked</hi> David <hi>to number the people,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21.1. And <hi>Satan sifted Peter</hi> when he fell so foully.
<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And besides, they greatly afflict their souls for such sins: David <hi>watered his Couch with his tears,</hi> and writ many penitential Psalms;
<note place="margin">Mark 26.</note> and Peter <hi>wept bitterly.</hi> I, but natural men, especially those who are given up to their own lusts by the just Judgment of God, they sin almost any sins with delight;
<note place="margin">Prov. 2.14.</note>
                  <hi>They rejoyce to do evil,</hi> and <hi>delight in the frowardness of the wicked, that will not endure any reproof;</hi> as many in these loose times rejoyce to make men, and see men drunk. And the Apostle in the first to the <hi>Romans, v.</hi> 29, 30, 31. speaking of the most dreadful sins committed by men, speaks of men that <hi>not only
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94446:85"/>do them, but take pleasure in them that do them.</hi> Now the more will and affection there is for sin, the more sinful it is. It is more the manner, than matter of sin, that shews the state of the heart. Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered simply is not the brand of a reprobate; for none of the Elect are without sin in this life.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.8.</note> It's willing and wilful sinning that denotes a wicked man. If the greatest sinner be upon the returning point to God, sin will not damn him; <hi>Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.30.</note>

                  <p n="1">1. This may be for a lamentation, that in our times there are so many desperate sinners that waste their Substance, not only their wealth, but their health, their parts and places, and all the Lord hath intrusted them with, they waste all in riotous living. Do we see great men great sinners? we have no need to envy their greatness, but to pity their great sinfulness and folly. Such practical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of to <hi>Titus</hi> 2.16. <hi>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess they know God, but in works they deny him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</hi> And because they profess to know God, and Christ, and the Scriptures, their sin is the greater, as Christ said to the Jews.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may much move you to admire and bless the Lord, whose will, and affections, and content, is taken off from all sin. It's as great a mercy, as that all your sins are forgiven you; for both are parts of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94446:85"/>the Covenant of grace. O look on it as mercy when God hedges up your way,
<note place="margin">Hos. 2.7.</note> when you are going out of his.</p>
                  <p>Art thou fearful when thou sinnest? bless God for so much mercy. Doth thy heart smite thee when thou hast sinned? bless God that sense of sin is not taken from thee. Hath God took away pleasure from thy sinning? bless God thou art so far delivered from sin. How many sinners are past feeling, and given up to a reprobate mind in sinning?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But may not such a sinner be converted?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not impossible; the case is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, though not utterly desperate. Conversion hath been the happy lot of the worst of Heathens; and Publicans and Harlots were converted,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.31.32.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. But when men pretend to know God, and to believe in Christ, and yet are greedy sinners, and sin without feeling, their case is more hopeless, and they are very near that heavy sentence,
<note place="margin">Rev. 22.11.</note>
                     <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</hi> But when men come to feel a bitterness in sin, and their conscience cannot bear with it, there is now some hope. Thus much for the the thirteenth Verse.</p>

                  <hi>Wherein is shewed, That great pain and sorrow do always follow the pleasures of sin. With Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hereupon by way of Ʋse; from the fourteenth Verse,</hi> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty Famine in that Land, and he began to be in want.</head>
               <p>IN the former Verse this younger Son, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of every man by Nature, acted his part in sin; and in these Verses we see him acting his part in sorrow: there we saw his <hi>bravery,</hi> here his <hi>misery.</hi> And here let us consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His misery it self in the fourteenth Verse; <hi>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty Famine in that Land; and he began to be in want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Course he took for his relief, in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verse; <hi>And he went and joyned himself to a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94446:86"/>Citizen of that Countrey: and he sent him into his field to feed Swine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Ineffectualness of that Course in order to his relief, in the sixteenth Verse; <hi>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks which the Swine did eat, and no man gave unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Of his distress and misery we have here expressed a double occasion; 1. <hi>He had spent all;</hi> and 2. <hi>There arose a mighty Famine in that Land.</hi> He was distressed within and without: Within, for he had nothing of his own left; he had spent all his Substance, his whole Portion; all was gone: And without also; there was a Famine in the Land whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was rambled from his Father's House; so that he was straitned on all hands. Though there had been a famine, if he had had something of his own, his case had been tolerable; or though he had nothing of his own, had there not been a Famine in the Land, he might have had hopes of supply: but he is every way distressed, as those Lepers were. <hi>If we say, we will go into the City, the Famine is there,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 7.</note>
                  <hi>and there we shall die: and if we sit still, we die also.</hi> And observe, It is said, <hi>there arose,</hi> or began, <hi>a mighty Famine in the Land; and he began to be in want.</hi> All his straits were but the beginning of sorrow, as Christ said, when he had spoken of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sore evils that would befall <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; All these are the beginnings of sorrow:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 24.8.</note> So was it with this man's straits; for like the flood, <hi>they increased, and prevailed mightily</hi> day after day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. The misery of graceless men hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but no end, if free grace dispose not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of it in their conversion, as it did in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal's Case. But we come to the spiritual things
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94446:87"/>which this part of the Parable means and intends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This intimates to us, That great pain and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row follows the pleasures of sin: first he spent all his Substance upon his lust; and then he was in want, and hedged in with straits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It intimates to us, That when men leave God to shift for themselves in this evil World (which is a far Countrey from God) they shall find a Famine therein; <hi>i. e.</hi> they shall find no satisfaction in the Creature: Let them have never so great a Portion, they shall have no satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The first of these shall be the subject of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> That great pain and sorrow follows the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sin. The sweet of sin is but for a season, and ends in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.25.</note> as <hi>Joab</hi> said of the Sword. Sin's best will be soon spent, and then comes its worst; but this is not gone so quickly. The Bee hath a sting as well as honey: There is a core in the forbidden Fruit, that will stick in a man's throat when he has eaten it. The pleasures of sin are not immortal things, but very flashes, and they go out like a Candle, with a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing snuff. Roses stay not always on the Tree, but are gathered, or wither, and shed, and then they leave prickles behind them.</p>
               <p>The pleasantness of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge was soon gone from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and changed into nakedness, and fears, and amazement. When the affections have acted their part in sin, then sin acts its part on the Conscience: yea when the pleasing affections, love, desire, delight, have had
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94446:87"/>their time in sin, then the bitter affections, grief, and sorrow, and vexation, have their season, and that for ever with many; <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Amnon,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> are examples.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was drinking Wine in the golden Vessels of the Temple,
<note place="margin">Dan. 5.3, 4, 5, 6</note> he saw that <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the wall,</hi> which made his <hi>countenance change, and his thoughts trouble him, and all his joynts to tremble.</hi> Sin will punish and plague men when they have spent their love upon it;
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.19.</note>
                  <hi>Thine own wickedness shall correct thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though a man have a long day of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sin, yet that day will have a night; and if bitter repentance prevent not, that night will never have day more after it.
<note place="margin">Rev. 21.25. Matth. 8.12.</note> As the Saints in heaven have no night, so the damned in hell have no day, but utter darkness. The pains of sin have a longer season than the pleasures. <hi>Rejoyce, O young man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 11.9.</note>
                  <hi>in thy youth,</hi> or youthful lusts, saith the Preacher, <hi>and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee to judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet it shall not be well with the wicked.</hi> And <hi>wo unto the wicked, it shall not be well with him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 3.11.</note>
                  <hi>for the reward of his hands shall be given to him:</hi> that is, God's unavoidable doom, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Tribulation and auguish upon every soul of man that doth evil. The end of these things is death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If men might have the pleasures of sin on earth, and after have the pleasures of God in heaven, the Scriptures would be disproved, and Christ should
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94446:88"/>die in vain, and the Law curse sinners in vain, and upon the matter, God would be found a lyar; he that believeth not God <hi>hath made him a lyar.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.10.</note> And what a heap of blasphemies would these suppositions rise to?</p>
               <p>Nay, if a righteous man should return to the pleasures of sin,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.24.</note> God hath professed <hi>that he should die, and not live.</hi> If a righteous man could do the one, God would do the other. If Angels sin, they must not stay in heaven, but be damned. All the world cannot forbid the banns between the pleasures of sin and eternal sorrow, unless Conversion alter the case.</p>
               <p>If <hi>David</hi> will have the pleasure of sin, he must have the pain of it too;
<note place="margin">Psal. 6.2, 3. Psal. 51.</note> his <hi>flesh must wither, and his bones be broken; and his soul must be vexed in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true, that our dear Lord Jesus Christ hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the sorrows of sin from the Saints so far,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1. Heb. 12.10.</note> as they are mortal; but not so far as they are medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Though they are kept out of hell, yet they may be brought to the borders. Though the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> shall not hinder <hi>Israels</hi> possessing of the good Land, yet they may give them great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. It is convenient that sin should end in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the Elect in this life, that they may taste what sorrow Christ felt for their sins; and what sorrows the damned do, and shall feel there; that so they may learn to set a high price and value upon the pardon of their sins, and their escape from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. O when a godly man's Conscience comes to feel the bitter that follows the sweet of any sin, this makes him a great admirer of the free grace of God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Let this be for a lamentation, That the world, yea much of the Christian world, should be so sottish as to buy the pleasures of sin for a season at such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive dear rate, as the hazard of eternal pains. This is like <hi>Esau</hi>'s selling his birth-right for a mess of Pottage. How can such men read or hear the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Job</hi> 21.13. if they believe it, without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? <hi>They spend their days in mirth</hi> (so it is in the Margent) <hi>and suddenly,</hi> or in a moment, <hi>go down into the grave;</hi> and it may be into hell one part, before into the grave the other.</p>
                  <p>Satan is the <hi>Prince of this world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.30. 2 Cor. 4.4.</note> and the <hi>god of this world</hi> by usurpation; and he rewards his Subjects with the pleasures of this world, and lusts of this world, to fit them to be tormented with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the next. As <hi>Abraham</hi> said to <hi>Dives,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16.25.</note>
                     <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that in thy life time thou hadst thy good things,</hi> the pleasures of this world; <hi>but now thou art tormented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Devil could not tempt Christ with all the Kingdoms of the world; but he tempts thousands with the base lusts of the world: He puts many tricks and cheats upon poor sinners. He lessens and sweetens sin before, and in the act; but greatens and imbitters it afterwards.</p>
                  <p>He troubles not for sin before he have tempted men to it, and then he often falls on the Conscience, as he did on <hi>Cain</hi>'s;
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13.</note>
                     <hi>Mine iniquity is greater than can be forgiven;</hi> and <hi>the punishment of my sin is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94446:89"/>greater than I can bear.</hi> Sin may be sweet in the swallow, as some Vomits are; but then it torments when it is in the stomack, and brings up bitter stuff: But here is the misery of it, that men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve till they feel,
<note place="margin">John 20.</note> as <hi>Thomas</hi> his unbelief said; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I feel, and see, I will not believe.</hi> Those that tell men of these things, they seem to them as mockers,
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.14.</note> as <hi>Lot</hi> did to his Sons in Law, and say in their hearts as those scoffing Jews at the Prophets threatning their sins with judgments; <hi>Let him make speed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 5.19.</note>
                     <hi>and hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the holy one of</hi> Israel <hi>draw nigh, and come, that we may know it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been an old practice of sinners to flatter themselves in the fulfilling their lusts;
<note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note>
                     <hi>I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine own heart. He flattereth himself in his own eyes, till his iniquity be found to be hateful, Psal.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> 36.2. Our blessed Saviour saith, that in the days before the flood, <hi>they were eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. and knew not till the flood came, and took them all away. And knew not!</hi> Did not <hi>Noah</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn them many years? Yes, but they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or believe him,
<note place="margin">Hos. 4.11.</note> till they saw it: <hi>Whoredome, and wine, and new wine, took away their hearts,</hi> and reason,

                     <note place="margin">Isa. 50.11.</note>
                     <hi>and with the sparks of their own fire;</hi> with their own fond reasonings and vain hopes. But what saith God to them? <hi>This ye shall have at my hands, ye shall lie down in sorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons this amongst the sins of the last times or days;

                     <hi>Men shall be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</hi> They let their own lusts take place of God in their hearts. What is it to be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94446:89"/>lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, but to follow a man's own lusts, rather than the will of God? When a man's pleasures take him off, or put him by any duty that God commands him, why now he loves his pleasure more than God: It's a plain convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the case.</p>
                  <p>For as <hi>Faith works by love, Gal.</hi> 5.6. so love worketh by obedience.
<note place="margin">John 14.15.</note>
                     <hi>If ye love me keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> So that when men will break through a Command of God to take their own pleasure, now they are <hi>lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</hi> But, <hi>O ye simple ones,</hi>

                     <hi>how long will ye love simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city?</hi> O turn ye at this days reproof; It's infinitely better to grieve and afflict your souls for sin, than to take pleasure in it. O sorrow for sin at present, that ye may not sorrow by it for ever; unless you do the former, you must do the latter; unless you do sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, you shall sorrow, as he said, <hi>Periissem, nisi pertissem,</hi> I had been undone, if I had not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.

Sin of it self is misery; as God in himself is blessedness. There is bitterness in sin, as well as for sin. It is bitterness to the people of God,

                  <p>There is more evil in sin, than in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Indeed sin it self is the greatest punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God inflicteth on sinners in this World: Because those Heathens sinned so greatly, therefore, as a punishment,

                     <hi>God gave them up to vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to a reprobate mind.</hi> Their latter sins were the punishment of their former, without any unrighteousness in God: And therefore when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had spoken of Gods punishment God inflicted on them for their sins, <hi>viz.</hi> his giving them over to sin, he saith of it, <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2.12.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can men take pleasure in sin, if sin be the greatest punishment of sin in this life?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Because whilst they are under the power of sin, it is no burthen to them, but pleasure: As a man that swims or dives under the water, feels it not a burthen, but pleasure to him; whereas if he went out of the water, the tenth part of that water on his shoulders would make him groan, and sink him down. And so when a man is delivered from under the dominion of sin, as he is when he cometh into a state of grace, those sins which were easie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to him before grace, are now the greatest trouble and vexation.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:94446:91"/>
                  <p>You see then how little reason men have to phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy pleasure in sin, or to reckon themselves happy when they may have their lusts; let not therefore our eyes dazzle at the men of this world, that have their fill of the pleasures of sin, and have liberty and opportunity to fulfill their lusts.
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.12, 13. Jer. 12.12.</note> It was <hi>Asaph</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s too, to be troubled in their minds at such a sight.</p>
                  <p>Alas, all their pomp is but a phantasy, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of that of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Berenice;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 25.28. Psal. 39.</note> so it is in the Greek: All is but a vain shew; as is a Dream when one awaketh; So, O Lord,
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.20.</note>
                     <hi>when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image.</hi> Dreams of honour, and pleasures, and riches, are not real, but imaginary things; men find it so when they awake out of their dreams.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth God make all these mens delight and pleasure in their lusts, the lusts of the flesh,
<note place="margin">1 John 2.16.</note> the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life to be but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary delights in their own sense and experience, when he awakens to Judgment, and awakens their Consciences unto Judgment.</p>
                  <p>We should therefore tremble at their courses, as well as their ends. So did holy <hi>Paul</hi> at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries he speaks of in <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are enemies to the Cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.</hi>

                     <hi>and in a moment go down to the grave,</hi> or to hell.

The Prodigal's Case tells us this; <hi>There arose a mighty famine in that Land,</hi> that far Countrey, <hi>and he began to be in want.</hi> This fell out before his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94446:98"/>return to his Father. The spiritual meaning and signification whereof is, That troubles of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Soul straits, are God's preparative to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's returning to him.
<note place="margin">Mark 3.</note> They are the sick that need the Physician. There is indeed sorrow and trouble for sin after Conversion,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.</note> which is called <hi>godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi> and this sorrow for sin is grace, for it is sorrow for sin, as sin is an unkindness to God: But this I am not speaking to now. There is a sorrow for sin before Conversion, and in order to it, which is not grace, but a preparation to it.</p>
               <p>Indeed this sorrow for sin, and trouble of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the sinners apprehension of wrath, may be dangerous, and an hinderance to grace, if not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ballas'd; It may bring to despair, as it did <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Judas:</hi> But rightly improved, it is a happy preparative to a natural man's return to God, as we see in this Prodigal. I say it is a happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative: because, though this trouble of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence begin in self-love, which God doth allow a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; yet he knoweth it will end in love to Jesus Christ;
<note place="margin">Luke 75.</note> as that womans, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a noted sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when she knew that <hi>much was forgiven her, she loved much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conviction of sin and pain of Conscience, through feeling or fear of Divine wrath, driveth a sinner to cast about for ease, and a better state than now he is in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how is a man prepared for Conversion by his sense of sin and misery?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This removes the barrs to a man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; <hi>scil.</hi> his ignorance, wilfulness, security, pride, self-flattery and presumption: These vanish away, when the true sense of sin and misery come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94446:98"/>to the Soul. When the Earthquake had set open the Prison doors, and put the Goaler into a trembling in his body and soul,
<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> he then cries out to those men he had used so severely, <hi>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet if Christ carry not on this work farther by giving in converting grace, it will be but a false Conception, or a miscarrying Womb. For the Law in its humbling and terrifying work gives not grace, but helps in fitting the heart to receive it. These sorrows of Conscience by the work of the Law le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel the hills and strong holds of pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption that hinder grace. <hi>John</hi> must prepare the way of the Lord.</p>
               <p>There are two things required in a sinners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; the removal of impediments, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of grace into the heart. The one is the work of the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> conviction of sin and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourings in the Conscience; and the other is Christ and his Gospel. If a room have light, there must be openings of the shuts, and shining of light of the Sun. If the shuts be not withdrawn, the Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shine into the room, nor the light come in; and if the Sun be not up, there can come no light, though the shuts be open. So impediments to Conversion must be removed by conviction of sin, and then God shines into the heart with <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Sense of sin, and straits of Conscience for it, make the sinner feel a need of Christ, as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did when the winds and storms were ready to sink the Ship or Vessel; <hi>Lord save us, we perish.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 8.24.</note> Thus when storms arise in the Conscience of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, now if the work be not hindered, it comes to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94446:99"/>this,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note>
                  <hi>Men and brethren what shall we do?</hi> and <hi>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16.30.</note> And now Christ is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be received on his own terms, <hi>i. e.</hi> with his Yoke and Cross: For no sorrows or sufferings for Christ are so bitter, as sorrow and sufferings in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for sin before a man come unto Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But doth God need this preparation-work in the conversion of sinners? Can he not give grace without thus shattering the Consciences of poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Question is not so properly what God can do, as what he will do in the case. This hath been God's path that he hath usually trodden in the work of Conversion, in the Conversion of <hi>adulti,</hi> such as have the use of Reason. Christ Jesus gave not grace to stocks or stones (though God is able to raise up Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of stones;)
<note place="margin">Matth. 3.9.</note> but Jesus gave grace to men and women prepared to it by the ministry of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, who preached first Repentance for sin,
<note place="margin">Matth. 3.2.</note> and then Faith in Christ. He can, and doubtless doth give grace to Children, as to those he took up in his arms and blessed:
<note place="margin">Mark 10.</note> But he gives grace in another way to such; the same grace, but in a different way.</p>
               <p>And this also must be yielded, That every sinners Conscience is not wounded alike in order to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The Smith makes not every Nail with his great Hammer; nor doth God smite every man's Conscience with the like terrour of the Law, that he brings to grace.
<note place="margin">2 Chro. 33.12.</note>
                  <hi>Manasseh</hi> was <hi>greatly humbled;</hi> and who knoweth how greatly? But if the Lord deal more favourably with some others, why should any man complain that his bones are set with a little pain? The Physician knoweth best how to use his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94446:99"/>Patient. God has pity on many a poor soul under the sense of sin, and drops of his wrath, lest <hi>Satan</hi> should get an advantage;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.8, 11</note> which was the reason why St. <hi>Paul</hi> willed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to carry it gently towards the repenting and grieving incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>O then bless God, if in thy Conversion he hath abated thee any thing of those terrible and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere shakings of Conscience, that some other sinners have had in theirs.</p>
               <p>It's true, that there are amazing Convulsions of Conscience in some men, who never reach Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or saving Humiliation for sin;
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13. 1 Kings 21.</note> as in <hi>Cain</hi> and in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab: Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself?</hi> So in <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>And there is in some a silent sorrowing for sin, which though it make no great noise in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet it kindly melts the heart, and makes a man lothe both his sins and himself, and fall into dear love with his Saviour. This was the Case of that woman in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. And for ought we read, most that the Lord Jesus himself called, he called in this way. He converted many Publicans and Sinners with a still voice: <hi>The bruised reed he did not break,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 12.20.</note>
                  <hi>nor quench the smoaking flax.</hi> He opened many sinners hearts without any terrifying-alarms of Conscience, as he did <hi>Lydia</hi>'s.
<note place="margin">Acts 16.14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>God can humble a sinner as well by the sense of mercy and free grace, as by the sense of his wrath. This is certain, that the Lord doth change his way in the Conversion of sinners: He hath, as St. <hi>Jude</hi> saith, <hi>compassion on some, putting a difference;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jude 22, 23.</note>
                  <hi>and others he pulls out of the fire.</hi> A yielding block needs not so great and hard a wedge, as a hard knotty piece of wood doth.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:94446:100"/>
               <p>And God lets some endure the greater pangs and throws in their Conversion, that they may be the better Midwives to those that may need them in the like condition. God useth the same matter and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in every sinner's Conversion; first conviction of sin, and then conviction of righteousnes— yet he uses not the same degrees: Some men have the sight of sin and of Christ almost together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what is the measure or required de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of humiliation or trouble of Conscience for sin in order to conversion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> When there hath been so much as brings the sinner out of himself, and off from all other San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries to Jesus Christ; and so to Christ, as that his mind would know him as the Gospel holds him forth to sinners; and the will would choose him, and the affections incline to embrace him, and upon his own terms; then there hath been sufficient trouble of Conscience for sin in order to a sinner's Conversion. This was <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> Case in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. for she is probably thought to be that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a noted sinner.</p>
               <p>The end of the terrour of the Law is to bring men to Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. Indeed if trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science drive sinners to Christ, only to prevent and save from damnation, this is not enough: For a throughly humbled sinner would have Christ, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the dominion, as well as the damnation of sin. He doth not divide Christ, but takes him in the whole; with his Scepter to rule in and over him and his sins, as well as with his Censer to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for them. Sufficient sorrow for sin takes a man not only off of his shifts, but off of his lusts also. He is weary of sin as well as sorrow.
<note place="margin">Mark 11.28.</note> Christ sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94446:100"/>is welcome to him, as well as Christ saving; and Christ purging, as well as Christ pardoning. A sinner is not sufficiently terrified with sin and wrath, till he come to say to Jesus Christ, as <hi>Saul</hi> did at his Conversion, <hi>Lord,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Let every man see to it, that his sorrow for sin have been sufficient; that it hath shew'd him his lost condition; turned him from all refuges but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; made him willing to give as well as to take; willing that he be Christs, as Christ his. Sorrow for sin that hath not these effects, is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                  <p>Many sinners look on sin through false Glasses: as 1. They measure sin by their own phansies, and so look upon it as a dead Serpent without a sting, or as a painted Lion, and so without fear of danger. Few men see sin with God's curse as it's sting;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56.</note>
                     <hi>The strength of sin is the Law.</hi> How? As it curses the sinner; as it is Mount <hi>Ebal</hi> to the sinner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men commonly judge of sin by God's patience towards sinners, and not by God's word. Because God lets sinners alone at present, and holds his peace; and <hi>because sentence is not speedily executed against an evil work;</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 8.11.</note>
                     <hi>therefore the heart of man is fully set in them to do evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:94446:101"/>
                  <p>But what saith God, to undeceive such men, in the quoted <hi>Psalm? These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; and thou thoughtest that I was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such an one as thy self: but I will reprove thee, and set thy sins in order before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God's patience should greaten sin in our eyes, and not lessen it;
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4, 5.</note> because sin multiplies under patience. Though God have long patience, yet there will be a day of reckoning betwixt him and the sinner: <hi>His transgression is sealed up in a bag; and God sews up his iniquity;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 14.17.</note> as <hi>Job</hi>'s expressions are. Yea, God himself saith as much <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34. <hi>Is not this laid up instore with me, and sealed up among my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?</hi> O then let men judge of sin, not by God's patience, but by his Law. Look on every sin as a debt in God's Book, that must be answered for. Christ would have us so to estimate sin,
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.12.</note> so that all our sins must be answered for, as having brought us into debt to Gods Law and Justice; and we, or Christ for us, must pay the debt: We cannot; and Christ will not pay any sinners debt, that knows not his debt and his own inability to satisfie it. Christ shed not his blood for presuming sinners. There was <hi>no Sacrifice</hi> allowed in the Law <hi>for sins of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 15.30.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it's the safest way for sinners to be <hi>Nathans</hi> to themselves, to discover their own sins to their souls, to load their prayers with confessions of them, and to give full audience to the Lectures of Conscience that will speak home to the sinner first or last. Sin lies at the door, ready to go into the Conscience when God saith <hi>Go.</hi>

                  <p>The Hebrews put sin for its punishment, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Take thy wife and thy daughters,</hi> saith the Angel to <hi>Lot, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the City, i. e.</hi> the punishment of it. Every man's sin will find him out, if he find not out it. <hi>Be sure your sin shall find you out, Numb.</hi> 32.23. <hi>i. e.</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it, and be humbled for it.</p>
                  <p>Jesus Christ escaped not the punishment of sin, when he undertook for their sins who came to him; and therefore let not any sinner think to escape the punishment of sin in his Conscience, who cometh not to Christ.</p>
                  <p>O spare not thine own soul in sorrow for sin, so far as thou findest it thy way to Christ. If remorse of Conscience for sin be not come, it will come: And the sinner may look upon himself within Gunshot, that is at ease, and in peace at present.</p>
                  <p>Think not that God hath forgotten those sins that thou thy self hast. Thou sinnedst so and so, and <hi>thoughtest I was like thy self;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 50.21.</note>
                     <hi>but I will set thy sins in order before thee.</hi> A man may be questioned by men for a murder done long since; how much more will a sinner be questioned for his sins, he sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> so many thousand years ago; and especially for those of his whole life, if he have not sued out his pardon by Christ? <hi>Remember, and forget not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 9.7.</note>
                     <hi>how thou provokedst God in the wilderness, from the day that thou didst depart from Aegypt.</hi> This was forty years since, yet <hi>Israel</hi> must remember this, and be humbled for it, or else there is no pardon for it. Men that live in sin, with easie thoughts of pardon, it's just with God to give them up to despair of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when their Conscience comes to sense of their sins.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:94446:102"/>
                  <p>But yet take heed, when sense of sin and wrath does come, of settling your selves in the <hi>valley of Achor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 2.15.</note> but see it to be <hi>a door of hope.</hi> God dislikes dispair in sinners, as much as presumption.

The Application in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us, That Conviction is but a partial Conversion; and of what nature are all false Refuges.

               <p>HAVING Considered the sinners misery, let us next see the course he takes for his relief,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94446:103"/>in the fifteenth Verse; <hi>And he went and joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a Citizen of that Countrey, and he sent him into his fields to feed Swine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here we have two things to be considered: 1. The project of this Prodigal for his relief in his great strait, <hi>He went and joyned himself to a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of that Countrey.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. There is the imployment the Citizen set him to, <hi>He sent him into his fields to feed Swine:</hi> mean and base service.</p>
               <p>As to the first, you'l say, Who is meant by this Citizen?</p>
               <p>It may be the Devil,
<note place="margin">Stella in Luc. James 3.15.</note> or carnal Reason, which is from the Devil. So St. <hi>James</hi> speaks of <hi>wisdom that is sensual and devilish.</hi> The Devil is called <hi>the Prince of this world,</hi>

<note place="margin">John 8.44.</note>
                  <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and his lusts ye will do.</hi> The Devil hath wicked men at his beck;

                  <hi>They are taken captive by him at his will.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> The carnal mind, which is <hi>enmity against God, sensual wisdom,</hi> which is of the Devil, <hi>James</hi> 3.15. This sent him not home to make his peace with his Father, but kept him in this far Countrey, though labouring under Famine. As <hi>Israel</hi> had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 14.4.</note> that had been to them a house of Bondage, than go forward to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the good Land of Promise.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:94446:103"/>
               <p n="2">2. As to his imployment this Citizen set him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, it was base, <hi>He sent him into his fields to feed Swine;</hi> which was intolerable to a Jew,
<note place="margin">Lev. 11.7.</note> to whom Swine were an abomination. It imports the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Satan puts natural men upon; they are his Vassals; he imployes them in very base work,

               </p>
               <p>The scope and spiritual meaning of this part of the Parable is this; It sets forth 1. the sorry shifts that men under Conviction and pangs of Conscience, as to their sinful state, do commonly make to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peace, and prevent their returning to God; any quiet from a brawling Conscience keeps them off from seeking peace with God. So that this is the first Doctrine, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                  </label> That when natural men come under troublesome Convictions of sin, and sense of wrath, their way is to fly to any vain and sorry shifts for ease, and not to God. It's the use of such to make lies their refuge: It runs in the heart-veins of natural men: <hi>We have made lies our refuge;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 28.15.</note>
                  <hi>and under falshood have we hid our selves.</hi> Like a man that is fallen into the water, he'l catch at any thing that is next to help him, though it do him no good.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:94446:104"/>
               <p>If a meer Moralist fall under these Convictions at any time,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> his sanctuary is, <hi>All these have I kept from my youth.</hi> If a Pharisee's Conscience check him,
<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> as it seldome does, his refuge is, <hi>I thank God I am not as other men, or as this Publican.</hi> If an ignorant Creature's conscience grumble, he betakes himself to his good meanings,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6.</note> as the <hi>Philistines</hi> did, when they sent away the Ark that plagued them upon a new Cart. If the Conscience of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man slie in his face, he slies to hereafter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; or God is merciful; or Jesus Christ died for sinners in the lump. And thus natural men, when against their will they are convinced of their woful condition, think thus to skin over the sore for present.</p>
               <p>And this is the reason why we have many convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced sinners, but few converted, because their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions send them to false refuges, and not to God. This Prodigal, when he was in want, and met with a mighty famine in a far Countrey, he speaks not a word as yet of his returning home to his Father; but he hires himself to a Citizen of that far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. So long as a sinner can make any shift to be quiet in his sinful state, he thinks not of his return to God. As it's said of <hi>Ephraim, when he saw his sickness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 5.13.</note>
                  <hi>he went to the Assyrian,</hi> not to God, though he missed there of healing for his wound.</p>
               <p>We have much experience how apt men are to ward off the blows of the Word from their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: And if a blow do light there, and hurt, their plaister is some worldly diversion; some deceitful lust in their heart asks them, as <hi>Jonadab</hi> did <hi>Amnon, Why art thou so lean from day to day?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.4.</note> or they think to wear it out in time, as some hardy men do by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily distempers.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:94446:104"/>
               <p>It's the practice of men in their sins to keep off their doom, as long as they can, by Apologies for themselves, having been taught it from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
                  <hi>The woman which thou gavest me, gave me, and I did eat.</hi> When <hi>John</hi> terrified the Pharisees and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with, <hi>O generation of Vipers, who hath warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> They imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately slie to their imaginary City of Refuge; <hi>We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>What a Catalogue of Pleas had <hi>Paul</hi> for himself before his Conversion? He had his birth,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.4, 5, 6.</note> and his sect, and his unblamable life, and his zeal in his way: but when he had obtained mercy and grace to be a Convert, he was ashamed of all those plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible shifts he had made to keep and nussle himself in his natural, sinful estate; he cast them all off as dross and dung,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.7, 8, 7.</note> when he came to know the necessity and excellency of Jesus Christ by experience; here he saw was a convicted sinners City of Refuge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>Poor sinners have their bushes to stand under when a shour comes, till there come a storm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that forceth them out to seek a safer place. When a sinner is ready to fall, then Satan puts a Reed in the shape of a Staff into his hand; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents to him an imaginary mercy of God, such as cannot be found in the holy Scripture; such a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as would destroy God's Justice, and Truth, and Holiness; such mercy as incourageth in sin,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.1.</note>
                  <hi>to sin that grace may abound.</hi> And if he be beaten off from this mercy, then he catches at hereafter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or at some negative goodness: He thinks in himself, he is not guilty of such and such sins as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94446:105"/>many are, and some of the godly in Scripture. I am the fuller in this case, because men are so full of shifts, when under convictions of sin, to hold them off from through Conversion to God.</p>
               <div type="reasons">
                  <head>Reasons of the Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>The Reasons why men, when under Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Conscience have recourse to false Refuges, are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From their ignorance: when they feel their wound, they are ignorant of a certain remedy, and therefore make many experiments: They are as men affrighted out of their sleep, that know not on the sudden where they are, or what to do. Mens Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Covenant of Works, and Grace, and of the state of nature and grace; or of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sin and grace; this ignorance makes them so fouly mistake in their Sanctuaries, when their sin finds them out, and the curse of the Law pursues their souls:
<note place="margin">Hos. 4.6.</note>
                     <hi>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.</hi> A blind man could not hit the way to any of the Cities of Refuge among the Jews: So poor ignorant souls, when they fall under terrour of Conscience, through their blindness they cannot hit their way to Christ, the appointed remedy. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan drives on a great design in blinding the minds of them that believe not,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> lest they should believe, and be healed: As the <hi>Philistines</hi> carried on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to destroy <hi>Sampson</hi> by putting out his eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:94446:105"/>
                  <p n="2">2. A second Reason is mens unwillingness to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Christ upon Scripture terms: Sinners would have Christ, but on their own terms; his are too high for them; to forsake all,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.37, 38— Luke 14.26. Gen. 12.11. Heb. 8. Matth. 19.21.</note> even their sweetest lusts, take up his Cross and follow him, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they go, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his own Kindred and Countrey; therefore they take up with cheaper stuff. Others, besides that rich man, think Christ's terms too hard. Jesus Christ is a City of Refuge to none that would have him and their lusts too: Indeed they may bring their sins to him, when they come themselves, but as their sores, of which they would be healed. But it's as hard for a natural man to leave his lusts, to follow Christ, as it was for that rich man to leave his great estate.</p>
                  <p>But doth not God offer Christ, and Christ himself freely, and without terms?
<note place="margin">Isa. 55.1.</note> — <hi>buy wine and milk without money, and without price.</hi> Yes; but this invitation is to such as thirst; <hi>Ho every one that thirsteth come</hi>— And this thirst of the sinner comes through the Consciences labouring under the burden of sin, and sense of Divine wrath:
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note>
                     <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet Christ's terms, he propounds to a sinner, hinder not the terms of the gift. It is but as if a man should bid you cast the stones out of your hand, that you may take an handful of silver or gold; for so the sinner is bid to cast his lusts out of his heart, that there may be room for Christ;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.31.</note>
                     <hi>Cast away from you all your transgressions</hi>— Now rather than a natural man will do this, he will close with any sorry shift to get his Conscience quiet.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:94446:106"/>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Reason is, because it is ease, and not grace, or Christ himself, that the sinner troubled in Conscience first desires and seeks. The troubled sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner does not naturally look out after grace, but ease; the soul is as eager of ease as the body. When the body is in great pain, a Countrey man will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny slip-sawce, as they say, for some ease, rather than he will go to the Physician; this is costly; he is for any thing that will stupifie the part grieved, and minds not to take away the cause of the grief.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth the soul of a natural man, when he is in pain; there any thing that will give him present ease is welcome: He'l stop <hi>Cerberus</hi> his mouth with a Crust. <hi>David</hi> must play away <hi>Saul</hi> his Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with his Harp. Yea, there is many a man, when in Soul-trouble for sin, and sense or fear of wrath, will fall to prayer and reading, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, &amp;c. to get some quiet within; but so soon as it is got, his Devotion is laid aside, as a man plucks off the plaister when he thinks the sore is well. When the Lord slew <hi>Israel,</hi> then they sought him, and <hi>enquired early after God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 78.34, 36, 41.</note> yet they did <hi>but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him;</hi> they turned back. A man in a storm will into his Neighbours house, not to dwell there, but for shelter, till the storm be over. So is it with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, when Conscience is affrighted, they are for good prayers, and good books, and good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but when the pain is past, they are as they were afore.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. This informs us, that a sinner, who is convinced of his sinful and miserable estate, is but half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: Indeed this is but the least part of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; to drive him out of his secret places, to keep him off from false refuges and self-shiftings, and to get him to Christ upon Christ's terms, and to stick there, is the better part of the work. To convince of sin is the Spirit's first work;
<note place="margin">John 16.8, 9.</note> but to convince of righteousness is the harder: What to keep him from false Sanctuaries on the one hand, and from despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasonings on the other, this is the more difficult business. Either a man is sullen, and will not hearken to a remedy for the wound, as <hi>Cain</hi> was;
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.6, 7.</note>
                     <hi>Why is thy countenance fallen?</hi> saith God to him: <hi>If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted?</hi> or else he betakes himself to the next hedge he meets with for shelter, and there he thinks himself as safe as the <hi>Jebusites</hi> in their strong hold, when they sent this message to <hi>David;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 5.6.</note>
                     <hi>Except ye take away the blind and the lame, ye shall not come in hither.</hi> The strong man in the sinner, that is Satan, will not be disarmed,

                        </gap>.</note> till a stronger than himself do the work, that is, the Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>Paul</hi>'s considence in his stock,
<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> and sect, and legal righteousness, were a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to his conversion, so that he was converted in a miracle.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Observe your aptness or aversness to apologize for sin, or for your selves in sin. Men hard to be convinced of sin, will easily take up with false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges when they are convinced: Most natural men withstand conviction as long as they can;
<note place="margin">John 9.</note>
                     <hi>Are we also blind?</hi> And when they are convinced, and come under the lash of Conscience, they will shark any where for present ease:
<note place="margin">Gen 4.</note> as <hi>Cain,</hi> when he was driven out of the presence of the Lord, full of terrour in his Conscience for his sin, he strove to make diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, in seeking a pleasant situation, and building a City for his safety, thinking (it may be) to drown the howlings of his Conscience; as the <hi>Italians</hi> of old were wont to do by Thunder, in ringing their great Bells, and shooting off their great Canon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Observe whether the Sanctuary you haste to upon conviction of sin, be a Scripture Refuge, or some forged apprehension of your own phansie. It is the Word rightly understood, and so applied, that is an easing plaister for a disturbed Conscience at sin. What saith the Scripture?
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.3.</note> It is the word of Christ that cures the sores of Conscience:
<note place="margin">Matth. 9.2.</note>
                     <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> It's the office of the Word to wound, and search the sinners Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. How did the Word make <hi>Felix tremble?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 24.25.</note> God smites the Earth with the <hi>rod</hi> of his mouth;
<note place="margin">Isa. 11.4. Hos. 6.5.</note>
                     <hi>I have hewed them by the Prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is also the office of the Word to heal a wounded Spirit;
<note place="margin">Isa. 50.4.</note>
                     <hi>The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season to him that is weary.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 4.18.</note> And, <hi>The Lord hath sent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi> O when convinced and grieved sinners put
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94446:107"/>their own wits to it for ease, it's a poor Medicine! <hi>Medicina est morbo imbecillior;</hi> the Potion is too weak for the Disease. A sinner must follow the Word for his guide in all Soul-straits, as the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> did the Cloud in the Wilderness; and look up to Jesus Christ for healing their stung Consciences,
<note place="margin">John 3.14, 15.</note> as they did to the brazen Serpent for their stung Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Sanctuary that a troubled Conscience takes to, leave or keep him in his sinful state, and loath to come out of it, as <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> this man makes lies his Refuge; he believes a lie;
<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2.11.</note> a judgment on the followers of the man of sin. The true Sanctuary of a grieved sinner is the free and rich grace of God in the Gospel, which is a great enemy to sin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. yea, though a man be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with some particular sins, if he be not willing to part with his sinful state, he leans but on a broken Reed if he charm his troubled mind with this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If a sinners Refuge in trouble of Conscience be injurious to the Attributes of God, his Mercy, his Justice, his Holiness, &amp;c. this man deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. How many, how many Conscience-galled sinners lick themselves whole with an imaginary mercy and grace in God? such a mercy as God hath not declared in his Word?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> supposeth in that prayer of his, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.5, that there are sinners to whom God will not be merciful.
<note place="margin">Numb. 15.30.</note> There was no SAcrifice in the Law for <hi>presumptuous sinners.</hi> As the Jews phansie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a strange Messias, which the Scripture knows not; so do many sinners, yea convinced sinners, phansie to themselves a strange mercy in God; such
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94446:108"/>a mercy as is injurious to his justice and holiness; such mercy as separates between the pardoning and purging of the sinner; whereas it's plain in the Word of Truth, that sin is nauseous, when the sinner obtaineth mercy and grace: grace and sin are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er contraries than fire and water; because the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is infinitely opposite to natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is infinitely so in God, and everlastingly so in his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Doctrine is useful to exhortation to all that have, or may have trouble of Conscience for sin. Take heed of false Sanctuaries, they will fail you at last,
<note place="margin">Psalm.</note> as <hi>Achitophel</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> who seemed to be his bosome friend.</p>
                  <p>It's not enough for you to know your lost conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but you must seek the way to be found, as this Prodigal at length did: You must know your Cure, as well as your Disease. And your only cure is Jesus Christ. The brazen Serpent in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. was a famous Type of this. <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. Let the sense of sin, and sorrow for it, send you to Christ; and you wrong him much, if you say or think he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or will not help you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that cometh unto me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 6.37.</note>
                     <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi> You'l find all other things Physicians of no value: and as <hi>Job</hi> said of his friends,
<note place="margin">Job.</note>
                     <hi>miserable comforters.</hi> O then come to Christ, and stick not in the way, but come home to him,
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note> and he'l ease your Conscience of it's burden; come to Christ on his own terms, and you are made for ever.</p>
                  <p>Take heed of carnal reasonings, when you would have ease in your Consciences. As <hi>John</hi> said to the Pharisees,
<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note>
                     <hi>Think not to say in your selves we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father:</hi> So think not to say within
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94446:108"/>your selves, God is merciful, and Christ died for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, meerly to quiet Conscience, that you may sin with ease. This is the way of the wisdome of the flesh to befool you. The wisdome of the flesh bids you apply your own Plaisters, and take your own Receipts, and not go to the Chirurgion or Physician, and so many convinced sinners perish in their carnal reasonings about the way of peace;
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.17.</note>
                     <hi>The way of peace they have not known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, what can imaginary shelters advantage you in real dangers? Will the shadow of a House keep you from wett in a storm? This is the case of many troubled sinners. Be jealous of Sanctuaries. Better to endure your pain, than to accept of false ease: Though there be danger in despair, yet there is more in presuming.
<note place="margin">1 Sam.</note> That it may be hath <hi>killed its thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,</hi> but the other <hi>its ten thousands;</hi> as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man said of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To take you off from carnal reasonings in this case; Consider</p>
                  <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> That carnal reason is blind in the ways of God with lost sinners. This is seen in natural men of the greatest parts and attainments, as in <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Doctor in <hi>Israel;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.</note> yet how simply did he reason and discourse Jesus Christ in the point of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The wisdom of the flesh is deceitful as well as blind: It hath of the Serpent in it,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.3.</note> which <hi>beguiled Eve through his subtilty.</hi> The wisdome of the flesh presents spiritual and eternal things to a man as they are not indeed: It puts a fair gloss of pleasure and profit on sin; but represents the ways of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely, as it did by Christ;
<note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note>
                     <hi>There is no comeliness in him, why we should desire him.</hi> It makes the way
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94446:109"/>to Heaven wider than the Scripture doth; and the way to Hell narrower; else how could any man say in his heart, <hi>I shall have peace, though I walk in the imaginations of my own heart?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Carnal reason, or the wisdome of the flesh is enmity against God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> and against his holy will: It maintains argument stiffly against many duties God requireth; and it vitiates the mind and judgment about spiritual things, as a foul stomack doth the palate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All carnal reasonings do but skin over the sores of Conscience, they will break out again: They may muzzle Conscience for a while; but it will awake, though at present it may be in a dead sleep, and like <hi>Sampson,</hi> will break all Cords and Wyths, and lay about it at the sinner, as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> did at the <hi>Philistines.</hi> O consider how the holy Scriptures speak enough, and enough again, against mens deluding confidences:
<note place="margin">Jer. 2. ult.</note>
                     <hi>The Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 28.17.</note>
                     <hi>The hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies.</hi> And, <hi>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass your selves about with the sparks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 50.11.</note>
                     <hi>walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled: This shall ye have at mine hand, ye shall lie down in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All carnal reasonings about your estate towards God are but foundations of Sand, that a showr or storm will wash away; and like that building with untempered morter,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 13.10, 11.</note> which the Hail-stones did rend. God will at length so shake and shatter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of such sinners, that all their leaning-stocks for ease shall fall, and they with them.</p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:94446:109"/>
                  <p n="5">5. While a man is under the sense of sin and wrath, there is some hopes; there are some hopes of his conversion, for he is in God's way to it: But when he betakes himself to consult with flesh and blood, the case is more desperate. It's a harder thing to overcome Souldiers in a Garison, than in the open Field; so is it harder to convert a sinner to God, when he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified himself with opinionative shifts and bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, than when his conviction of sin lays him open to the fear of God's wrath. The Pharisee's own righteousness kept them from Jesus Christ; so do a sinners own carnal reasonings.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is Satan's way, when he sees a sinner wearied with Conscience-conflicts,
<note place="margin">Judges 4.</note> to allure him into his tents, as <hi>Jael</hi> did <hi>Sisera,</hi> and there sooths him with carnal reasonings for some ease and quiet, till the opportunity come, and then slays him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But what kind of reasonings have men to get loose from disquieting Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Very many: I'le speak of some.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The heart reasons thus; There are thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, yea millions, that walk and live as I do. But to this men should reply;
<note place="margin">Exod. 23.2.</note>
                     <hi>Follow not a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to do evil:</hi> we know <hi>the whole world ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in wickedness,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19.
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.14.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; few there be who find the way to life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:94446:110"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Some times men may reason thus; Very many of the great and learned men of the world, the Christian world, tread the pathes that I do, and if they be not saved, who can? As they said,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.23, 24, 25.</note> when Jesus said <hi>a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of heaven, who then can be saved?</hi> say his Disciples. This is like their reasoning in <hi>John</hi> 7.58. <hi>Have any of the Rulers of the Pharisees believed on him?</hi> But to this reply that of the Apostle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note>
                     <hi>Brethren, ye see your calling, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some argue thus in themselves; This is an easie way I am in; my Conscience would let me have no quiet before, and I see there is nothing but trouble and melancholy in a stricter and preciser course; Why should I travel forty years through a wearisome Wilderness to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> as some do? I, but to this reply; This carnal ease and pleasure is the Devil's Paradise: And what comfort is it to the Bee to be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in honey? Remember Father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s words to that <hi>Dives,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16.25.</note>
                     <hi>Remember, that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, but now thou art tormented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O for <hi>Moses</hi> his faith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> who chose rather to suffer afflictions with the people of God, than to injoy the pleasures of sin for a season. And for <hi>David</hi>'s mind,
<note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> who <hi>esteemed a day in Gods Courts better than a thousand elsewhere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, when any of you come under rebukes and terrours of Conscience for sin, make

               <p n="1">1. In tempting men to as much sin as he can, to such sins as himself cannot act. He tempts them to Atheism, though he himself cannot be one; the Devils believe that there is a God,
<note place="margin">James 2.19.</note> and tremble. He tempts them to Drunkenness and Adultery, sins that he cannot properly act. He provoked our first Parents to eat,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> but he himself could not eat. Yea, Satan hath influence on them in their best actions and works, in their callings, in their holy perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances:
<note place="margin">Zach. 3.1.</note>
                  <hi>He stood at</hi> Joshua<hi>'s right hand to resist him, when he stood before the Lord for the people.</hi> But he hath power on carnal mens hearts, when they come before the Lord. He matters not how much of Religion they do, so he can poison their manner and ends. He may carry men to Church in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> as he did Jesus to a Pinacle of the Temple. The Devil had power over their souls,
<note place="margin">Matt. 7.22, 23.</note> who had power to cast him out of other mens bodies. Satan can tempt no Creature but man to sin; and so he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirs himself among them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He puts them on to presume on the goodness of their present and final estate, however they live in this World. He teacheth them to say, <hi>We shall have peace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note>
                  <hi>though we walk in the imagination of our own hearts.</hi> The unbelieving Jews could not be moved from their confidence, that they were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s <hi>Children;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 8.44.</note> though our blessed Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to them, that they were <hi>of their Father the Devil.</hi> A lying Spirit deludes them, as he did <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> that arch false Prophet, in making him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that he had the Spirit of the Lord, and by that gave counsel to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:94446:112"/>
               <p n="3">3. In presenting to their minds lying Refuges, when they are under painful convictions of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for sin:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> Satan <hi>transformeth himself into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light</hi> to the sinner: He can turn himself into any shape or appearance,
<note place="margin">Proteus by the Paynims called the god of the Sea.</note> as the Poets feign of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus.</hi> As Satan helps the man of sin to <hi>do lying wonders,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.9. so he helps many troubled sinners to lying Sanctuaries. It is likely he set <hi>Cain</hi> on building a City, to charm the evil Spirit that vexed him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If this way fail, then he aggravates the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners trouble of Conscience for sin, to get him into despair: not that he affects mens being troubled for their sins; but when they are sorrowful this way, he would have them swallowed up of over-much sorrow.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.7, 11.</note> This is one of Satan his devices to get an advantage of the sinner, to bring about his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Satan makes many a soul pine away in their sins,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.10— Job 2.9.</note> as those Jews said of themselves, and perswades them to <hi>curse God, and die,</hi> as he would have done <hi>Job.</hi> And as he prompted his Friends to esteem him a Hypocrite: so he prompts many a Conscience-wounded-sinner to look upon himself as a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, as having out-sinned mercy, and he must be damned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how cometh it to pass that natural men are no more sensible of this power of Satan o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Because he blinds their minds,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi> put out <hi>Sampson</hi>'s eyes, and did with him what they list: He deadens their sense of feeling. The holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of sinners that are <hi>past feeling.</hi> Satan is a Juggler,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.19.</note> and an
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94446:113"/>Impostor,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.3.</note> or Deceiver, from the beginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Have natural men no power to resist the Devil?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> They have lost it very much. <hi>Adam</hi> had power, if he had used it; and Jesus Christ had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and did use it; and men in a state of grace have power to <hi>resist the Devil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 4.7. 1 John 2.14. 1 John 5.18.</note> and <hi>to overcome the wicked One,</hi> and <hi>to keep themselves that the wicked One touch them not, i. e.</hi> with a destructive touch; such a touch as he moved the Lord to touch <hi>Job</hi> with.</p>
               <p>Satan indeed hath power to tempt the Saints, and in part to get advantage of them. He <hi>provoked</hi> David <hi>to number the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 21.1. Luke 22.31. Jo. ch. 1. &amp; 2. Zach. 3.7.</note> and he did it; and he <hi>winnowed Peter;</hi> and he assailed <hi>Job</hi> very hard; and <hi>he stood at</hi> Joshua <hi>the High Priests hand, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him, when he stood before the Lord.</hi> Our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour hath taught us to pray daily,
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.13.</note> that <hi>we be not led into tempiation.</hi> Yet Satan hath not that power over the Saints, as over other men; yea, as over man in the state of innocency, <hi>i. e.</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them from God, and from a state of grace. It's true, man in innocency in one respect had the advantage against Satan, which men in a state of grace have not now; in that he had no sin to joyn with Satan:
<note place="margin">John 14.13.</note> In this point he might say, as our Lord Jesus did; <hi>The Prince of this World cometh, and hath nothing in me.</hi> Yet the Saints now have that power against and over Satan in other cases, that men in innocency had not;
<note place="margin">Luke 22.32.</note> power to resist him, power to overcome him:
<note place="margin">Rom. 16.20.</note> Christ <hi>prayeth for their faith;</hi> and they have a promise that <hi>Satan shall be bruised under their feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:94446:113"/>
               <p>I, but natural mens power to resist the Devil is but small; some they have, <hi>i. e.</hi> when he tempts to sins against the light of nature,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15.</note> and a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in these they may resist temptation. There are many sins that natural men sin, which they falsly charge upon Satan, they would sin if Satan were dead and buried; they are as willing to some sins as the Devil would have them; as the Pharisees and Jewish Rulers were to be rid of Jesus.</p>
               <p>It's to be observed in Scripture, that the people of God charge not the Devil in the confession of sin, as <hi>Eve</hi> did with hers; <hi>I have sinned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.17.</note>
                  <hi>and I have done foolishly,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> He pleads not that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan provoked him, as <hi>Eve</hi> did, that the Serpent gave her, and she did eat. But many wicked men charge their sins upon the Devil, when they tempt him to tempt them,

                  <p n="1">1. Let no man be too fearless of the Devil; he hath great power in the world,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> especially over this men of this world; he is called <hi>the god of this world;</hi> he would be so,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.2.</note> and the Lord lets him be so to some men, in some things. He is <hi>the Prince of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Air, that worketh in the children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi> Yea, he may have power over the people of God, to tempt them,

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:94446:114"/>
                  <p>He put on <hi>Peter</hi> to disswade Christ from his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> for which he had this check, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan.</hi> He winnowed all the Disciples, and thereupon they all left him when apprehended. And <hi>Paul</hi> himself, after he had been in the third Heaven,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note> was <hi>buffeted by a messenger of Satan.</hi> Yea, he was permitted to tempt our Lord Jesus to a most horrid sin;
<note place="margin">Matth. 4.4, 8.</note> and to carry his body to a Pinacle of the Temple, and after into a high Mountain.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and Satan may be in possession of souls, and not be known; the Devil often works in men <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito.</hi> Of all Creatures he would possess men; and though he acted by the Serpent's head, yet his aim was at <hi>Eve,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sen. 3.1.</note> and <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart. He got leave to go into the Swine, yet his design was at their owners, to make them disgust Jesus the more; and so they did,

                     <hi>They besought him to depart out of their Coasts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Devil knows that men only, of all Creatures in this world, are capable of sin and hell; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lays his contrivances against men, to bring as many as he can into his own Condemnation: And he had rather possess their souls than their bodies; he would have the best room in the house for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that's the heart; <hi>He entred into</hi> Judas <hi>his heart,</hi> and <hi>into</hi> Ananias <hi>his heart: Why hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan filled thy heart?</hi> Yet Satan's spiritual possessions may be known, and how? why, when men will do the lusts of the Devil;

                     <hi>Ye delight to do his lusts.</hi> The lusts of the flesh in carnal men, are so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirits: Not that the Devil does all these works of the flesh, but he tempts men to all. He did not dance about the golden Calf,

                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:94446:114"/>
                  <p>Let no man therefore be too fearless of Satan. <hi>Paul</hi> was jealous over the believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.3.</note>
                     <hi>Lest as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve, <hi>their minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet let not any sinner, under the power of conviction of sin, despair of Conversion, because of the power that Satan improves to hinder it. For consider,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16. 1 Cor. 1. Acts 26.18.</note> that the word of reconciliation which is preached to you, is the <hi>power of God</hi> to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greatest of sinners. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turned men <hi>from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Therefore let such wait on the Ministery of the Gospel, and do it in hope, as the infirm people did for the Angels troubling of the waters of that heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pool, <hi>John</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>And be advised also to be in the company of the godly; Satan hath not that power to vend his wares there, as among other Company. The Spirit of Divination knew this in that possessed Damosel he made use of to disturb <hi>Paul</hi> and his holy Company in their meeting to pray; their prayers,
<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note>
                     <note place="margin">v. 18.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s authority from the Lord Jesus, cast him out.</p>
                  <p>In thy trouble of Conscience for sin be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much alone. In this case I may use the words of the Preacher, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Wo to him that is alone.</hi> Solitariness in this season is Satan's house of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; he assaults where there is no help in resisting him, as he did by <hi>Eve.</hi> The evil Spirit used that man to solitariness <hi>Luke</hi> 8.27. God is much for the society of his people; he appears with his power and glory in the Assemblies of the Saints. Frequent solitariness is useful indeed for men of grace;
<note place="margin">Mark 1.35.</note> Jesus Christ went oft aside into a solitary place: but poor souls afflicted in their spirits for sin, should be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94446:115"/>afraid of it, as Children are to be alone.</p>
                  <p>And be further advised to follow faithfully the affairs of your Calling:
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.25.</note> Idleness is the Devil's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time. While men slept, the Enemy came and sowed his tares.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11.</note> When <hi>David</hi> was lazing and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on his House-top, the Devil presented an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to stir up his lust.</p>
                  <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.26, 27.</note> take heed of an angry passionate spirit; this gives place to the Devil: And take heed of an envious spirit; Satan is the envious one; he filled <hi>Cain</hi> with envy at his brothers good works, because his own were evil: And beware of a discontented spirit; this was one of the Devil's first sins, and the sin of our first parents: And above all, seek to Jesus Christ for deliverance from Satan's bondage.
<note place="margin">John 8.36. Luke 4.18.</note>
                     <hi>If the Son make you free, ye are free indeed. He was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed to preach deliverance to the captives. He loosed the daughter of</hi> Abraham,

                     <hi>whom Satan had bound eighteen years;</hi> and it is observable how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately Jesus both spake and did in her case.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is comfort to God's people, that Satan's power is exceedingly broken as to them; he hath no interest in them,
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12. to the 18th. John 14.17.</note> and they have armour of proof, both defensive and offensive against him. You have the Spirit in you to guide and assist you; and <hi>he that is in you,</hi>

The Devil writes all his Laws in Blood, as <hi>Draco</hi> did; O but Jesus Christ came meek into the World to save sinners; and he came into his Ministery with a beseeching Spirit to sinners; and left such a spirit in his Ministers, that were to treat sinners in his Name, when he was gone to the Father: <hi>As though God did beseech you by us,</hi>

               <p>Sin laps and rolls up it self in sugar to natural mens lust,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> though it be filthiness in it self. The mire and dunghill are filthy and stinking things,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.22.</note> and yet it's pleasure to Swine to wallow in it.</p>

                  <p>This shews us, That to serve sin and lusts is a base service; it is the Devil's drudgery he sets car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men about: As such are slaves to Satan,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> who leads them at his pleasure so are they slaves to their own lusts, yet willingly so; so they love to have it.
<note place="margin">Jer. 5.31.</note> As <hi>Ephraim</hi> walked willingly after the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their idolatrous Princes,
<note place="margin">Hos. 5.11.</note> so carnal men walk willingly after the command of their own lusts, their corrupt and worldly desires: As they said to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 18.12.</note>
                     <hi>We will walk after our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O that men would consider it, that the service of sin is a base service, it makes men Swineherds. It may be pleasure to them, as mire is to Swine; but to sanctified souls it's base and fulsome: Carnal men are unclean Creatures. As in the Law there were clean and unclean Creatures, so are there such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel; regenerate and spiritual men are the one, and natural carnal men are the other. Spiritual men are so ashamed of the filthiness and uncleanness of their natural state they are got out of,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 6.9. c. 16.63. c. 20.43. c. 36.31.</note> that they loath themselves at the thoughts of it: But natural men <hi>glory in their shame, Phil.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:94446:118"/>
                  <p>God made man an honourable Creature,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> in his Image,
<note place="margin">Psal. 49.12, 20.</note> and after his Likeness: but man hath made himself like a Beast; else it would be a strange thing, that men, who are Creatures capable of the highest enjoyments, even of glory, and of the God of glory himself, should take up with so low and base things, as any sinful sensual pleasures. And whereas God <hi>put all things under his feet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 8.6.</note> he now puts himself under foot, under the basest of things, the vilest lusts. This man does by nature and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in sin.</p>
                  <p>Some men make their bellies their gods;
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of such with tears. <hi>Israels</hi> golden Calf was their god.
<note place="margin">Exod. 32. Isa. 36. Dan. 11.</note> Some men make themselves gods; as <hi>Sennacherib, Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and many more. As it was said to <hi>Judah, Jer.</hi> 2.28. <hi>According to the number of thy Cities, so are thy gods, O Judah;</hi> so may it be said to a natural, carnal man, according to the number of thy lusts, so are thy gods.</p>
                  <p>And you who are now spiritual, you your selves were as these in your natural state, as the Prodigal was before his conversion; you fed Swine, and fed with them while you were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted;
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note>
                     <hi>We our selves were sometimes foolish and disobedient, serving divers lusts. Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 3.3.</note>
                     <hi>and of the mind, and were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the children of wrath, as well as others.</hi> There is no difference among men, till effectual Calling make it. Election leaves men equally vile and wretched, till Conversion come and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish. It's true, Election makes a difference
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94446:118"/>in God's purpose, but not in the quality of the persons, till grace doth it. There is no difference in the Clay whilst in the lump, but only in the Potter's intention, and hands afterward.</p>
                  <p>And so we are all alike in sin,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> and under wrath, till effectually called by God out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into his marvellous light.</p>
                  <p>God suffers his Elect to be born in sin, and live in sinful lusts till the time of their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then he makes them visibly to differ from other men: and therefore a judgment of the final state of natural men, even the greatest sinners, cannot be made by their present state; for though they are now in a natural condition, they may be elect vessels, and if so, shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to grace in their time. Indeed, such a mans state may be judged what it is at present; but his final estate is a secret.</p>
                  <p>And for such as are effectually called to grace, you should often look back to what you were by nature; <hi>Such were some of you,</hi> saith St.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> to the converted <hi>Corinthians, fornicators, idolaters, &amp;c.</hi> And to the believing <hi>Romans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note>
                     <hi>Ye were the servants of sin;</hi> and to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>

                     <hi>We were by nature the children of wrath as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereupon admire free grace in your change, <hi>that when you were in your blood,</hi> I say,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.6.</note> when you were in your blood, <hi>the Lord said unto you live. This my Son was dead, and is alive.</hi> And now you have this priviledge, that you are out of that base service and drudgery to sin and lusts, which carnal men are in. And let this indear the love and free grace of God and Christ to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94446:119"/>you, and of the Spirit in you, That you can say, and say truly and feelingly, as he did in the Ninth of <hi>John, I was blind, but now I see:</hi> I was an unclean Creature, but now am washed: I fed Swine, and did feed with them; but now at my Father's Table.

               <head type="sub">
                  <hi>Wherein is shewed, That the things of this World, which natural men's hearts, for the satisfaction of their lusts, would feed upon, are, in the judgment of our Saviour Christ, no better than Husks and Swines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat. In what respect they are so, exemplified in two Particulars; from the first part of the Sixteenth Verse,</hi> And he would fain have filled his belly with the Husks which the Swine did eat.</head>
               <p>I HAVE already represented to you</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prodigal's Misery, from Verse the fourteenth; <hi>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that Land, and he began to be in want.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:94446:120"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Course he took for his Relief, from Verse the fifteenth; <hi>And he went and joyned himself to a Citizen of that Countrey; and he sent him into his fields to feed Swine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now, in the last place, to shew the Ineffectualness of that Course in order to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, from the sixteenth Verse; <hi>And he would fain have filled his belly with the Husks which the Swine did eat, and no man gave unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former Verse the Prodigal found imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his strait, such as it was, he was <hi>sent into the field to feed Swine;</hi> but yet he got not a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance by it. He had work, but no wages; not so much as bread to eat. His work was to feed Swine, and he would have been content to feed with them, if he might have had it. <hi>He would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the Swine did eat, but no man gave unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this Verse sets forth the insufficiency and ineffectualness of the Prodigal's course he steer'd to supply and relieve himself in his extream straits. He was content with worse imployment than the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Josh. 9.5, 21.</note> who were made <hi>hewers of wood, and drawers of water to all the Congregation of</hi> Israel. This was a worthy service towards the Prodigal's feeding Swine: And their mouldy bread, old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and old shoes and clouted, were brave clothes and diet towards the Prodigal's feeding on Swines-meat, the husks that they did eat and feed on, and glad too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what were these husks?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It's plain they were Swines-meat. And these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, here called husks, as some of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed observe, were <hi>Egyptian</hi> figs; a course unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94446:120"/>fruit, not fit for man's meat, but Swines. And <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, the rind of them was that which was eaten, and therefore they are called husks. They were a little sweet, but very hard of concoction, and the juyce very unwholesome. Yet this Prodigal wished for these <hi>Egyptian</hi> figs, these husks that were Swines meat, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did for the Leeks, and Garlick, and Onions of <hi>Egypt; But no man gave unto him, (i.e.)</hi> he could not get enough to fill his belly: He still missed of content and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>For the spiritual meaning, it shews us, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinted, the ineffectualness of this mans course, who is the Representative of all natural mens seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief in Conscience-straits and troubles, when they come to be convinced sinners. And the words hold forth four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the things of this World, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mens hearts would feed on for content, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their lusts, are but Husks and Swines meat without God. As Swine in the fifteenth Verse signifie worldly and sensual men, that live upon their lusts; so these Husks, or Swines meat, signifie the things of the World, <hi>the lusts of the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 2.16.</note>
                  <hi>the lusts of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> which carnal mens souls seeks after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas it is said, that <hi>he would fain have filled his belly with the Husks that the Swine did eat;</hi> it shews the property of natural men in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science-straits, <hi>viz.</hi> That they would sit down with the basest things of this World with ease, rather than return to God.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:94446:121"/>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas it's said, <hi>and no man gave him;</hi> it shews, that nothing shall be able to give a sinners troubled Conscience relief and comfort, nothing of this World, when God means to bring him home to himself.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the lowest step of a sinners misery is not to see and feel himself in a sinful and dangerous state; but to see himself without remedy, and to find all refuges to fail him. Of these in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

               <p>Power, parts, riches, honour, pleasure, all these in conjunction availed not <hi>Haman,</hi>

                  <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are vain.</hi> God calls them so, and men who have made trial of them, have found them so. Let <hi>Solomon</hi> speak for all; he found all <hi>vanity of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94446:121"/>vanities,</hi> yea, and <hi>vexation of spirit;</hi> nothing, and worse than nothing, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.2.</p>
               <p>And the Devil himself thinks them so; and therefore he would have given all the Kingdoms of the World, had it been in his power,
<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> for one bow of Jesus his knee. And though he use honour, and pleasure, and silver, and gold, as baits to tempt men to sin, yet he values them not himself.</p>
               <p>A House full of silver and gold,
<note place="margin">Num. 22.18.</note> as <hi>Balaam</hi> said to the Servants of <hi>Balak,</hi> are but trifles to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, saving as they are bait and temptation to men to sin. What is a flie or a worm to a man, but as they are his baits to catch fish?</p>
               <p>And at last the men of this world find the things of this world lighter than vanity, as the Psalmist saith of men of high degree;
<note place="margin">Psal. 62.9. Prov. 11.4. Zeph. 1.18.</note>
                  <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath.</hi> Neither their silver nor their gold <hi>shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the things of the world, to which men grip'd in Conscience for sin, and with fear of wrath, are wont to go for ease, are but husks and trash in this Case, in a double comparison.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In comparison of the Soul of man. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. In comparison of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In comparison of the Soul of every man, and that in a double respect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the great disproportion between the Soul of man and the things of this world. Man's Soul is of divine extraction; it is the off-spring of God;
<note place="margin">Acts 17.28. Gen. 2.7.</note>
                  <hi>God breathed into man the breath of life, and he became a living Soul.</hi> And therefore something Divine must sustain the Soul.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:94446:122"/>
               <p>But all the things of this world are of an earthly original, all came out of the Chaos, as man's body did, which was formed of the dust of the ground: So that that which feeds the Body will not feed the Soul. And however the more choice things of the world, as honours, riches, pleasures, make a fair shew, and a goodly appearance; yet it is but to the phansie or sensual faculties: As it was said of King <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Berenice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 25.23. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> came into the place of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature with great pomp; or as it is in the Greek, with great phantasie. Now if the greatest of these outward things cannot satisfie the Soul of man, much less can they satisfie the troubled Conscience of a convinced sinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And again it is considerable, That the greatest things of this world, and the greatest share of them, have been, and are bestowed on Reprobates, and such as God hates;
<note place="margin">Mal. 1.3.</note> as he said of <hi>Esau, I hated Esau;</hi> I rejected him,
<note place="margin">Acts 14.16.</note> left him to himself, and his own lusts and ways, as he did the Nations or Gentiles in times past;
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> he left <hi>Esau</hi> to be prophane <hi>Esau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet God gave to <hi>Esau</hi> large earthly possessions: <hi>Behold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 27.39.</note>
                  <hi>thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; and thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</hi> So he did within an hundred and twenty years, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.20. and so continued for Eight hundred years and above; yet <hi>Esau</hi> was hated of God.</p>
               <p>Now things that are given even to Reprobates as their Portion in this life,
<note place="margin">Psal. 17.</note> they can have no relieving and refreshing influence on afflicted Consciences, and poor Souls under the sense of God's wrath. That which gives any ease or true lasting rest to a sinners perplexed Conscience, must be that which can bring
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94446:122"/>a sinner near to God, and into his saving favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ can do this: But now in Christ Jesus,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.13.</note>
                  <hi>Ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh, through the blood of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The union of the Body and Soul of a man is by his own blood; but that which unites a man to God again, is the Blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Though straw and hay nourish a Beast, yet it will not nourish a man, unless God give a man the heart of a Beast, as he did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>So the things of this world may nourish the lusts of worldly men, but they cannot relieve a Soul that hungers and thirsts after the pardon of sin, and peace of Conscience; they are altogether useless to a sinner in his spiritual misery; they can neither ease the pains, nor supply the needs of such a Soul. For that pain is from the sense of the displeasure and wrath of God; And what can worldly things do in the asswaging of this pain?</p>
               <p>If a perplexed sinner go for ease to any thing of this world, he does as <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.</note> when he went to the Witch to resolve him in his present straits; or as <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> when in their sickness, they sent to the <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> and as <hi>Judah,</hi> when they felt their wound,
<note place="margin">Hos. 5.13.</note> sent to King <hi>Jareb:</hi> These could not heal them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But have not some men ease in ther gripes of Conscience by their recourse to the things of this world?
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.17.</note> As it may be <hi>Cain</hi> had by building a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so some by Dogs, and Hawks, and Horses, and other sensual pleasures, as <hi>Lewes</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi> Some in taking up their minds and thoughts on their riches and grandure in this world, as that man our Saviour spake of, who said to his Soul, <hi>Soul,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.19.</note>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:94446:123"/>thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, such men may have some ease for the present, as an aking tooth by the use of some Medicines, but no Cure. These things may cast a sinners Conscience into a sleep or stumber, as rocking does a Child that cries; I but Conscience will waken again, and in greater pain. The wrath of God felt in a sinners Conscience, is too great a wound for so weak a Plaister as the world to cure. The things of this world may suit well with worldly mens lusts, and evil concupiscence; as some women find plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sometimes in eating trash, and children in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coles and dirt; but it puts them to pain after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. As <hi>Eve</hi> did in eating the forbidden fruit; it agreed well with her Lust, but it did not so with her Conscience. Those things that please mens Lusts, do after grieve and trouble their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The things of this world are but trash to a troubled Conscience for sin, in respect of Grace: Its Grace that relieves the Conscience in trouble; the free Grace of God in Christ towards lost sinners. O when the wounded spirit comes to see, that <hi>where sin abounds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note>
                  <hi>grace doth much more abound;</hi> this is a healing Plaister for a sinners sore within.</p>
               <p>And men may take notice of the vast difference betwixt the things of this world and grace, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards, but in a man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The best things of this world are but of short continuance;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.31.</note>
                  <hi>the fashion of the world passeth away:</hi> But Grace is of an eternal nature, it is glory begun; and Conscience in man is an immortal faculty, it never dieth. And so Conscience must have ease and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94446:123"/>peace by that which is immortal like it self; and the best of this world is not so.</p>
               <p n="2">2.
<note place="margin">Eccles. 9.1.</note> None of the things of this world can evidence God's love to a man, or a man's conversion to God. No man's Election or Calling can be evidenced to him by any thing of this world. The Apostle cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rich men,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> that they <hi>trust not in uncertain ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> some render it, <hi>to the unevidence of riches.</hi> They can give no certain evidence of a man's state towards God. When a rich man falls into trouble of Conscience, his silver and gold, and lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, are miserable Comforters; these cannot scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fears, nor answer his doubts, nor give any ease to his perplexed Soul.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AND First, This may rectifie our opinion of the things of this world; when we set them in God's stead, they are but Swines meat, and they are swinish that set their hearts upon them, and seek happiness in them.
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.22.</note> The Psalmist calls himself a Beast, for his conceit of mens being happy in having this world at will.</p>
               <p>Would any of you think a man the richer for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Garner full of husks or chaff? yet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively these worldly things are such, they are no more to an afflicted Conscience, and prove so at last to all that have confidence in them.
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> And yet how generally are men given over to an injudicous mind in this Case?</p>
               <p>Yet the spiritual man, who alone can give a right judgment of things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. he is of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s mind, when returned to his right mind, That whoever seeks satisfaction in the best of this world,
<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.2.</note> shall increase and multiply his vexation of spirit.</p>
               <p>Worldly men look on worldly things through a magnifying Glass, a vitiated phansie; but a man of another world as well as this, looks on them through
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94446:124"/>the Glass of God's Word, and his own Experience, and so escapes an errour in the Case. The more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual a man is, the less he'l mistake in his thoughts of the things of this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This point is useful to rectifie our desires of the things of this world. We may desire them, but not lust after them, as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> did after flesh. Since the fall of man, man is composed and made up much of desires; his Soul runs out this way in desire after forbidden fruit;
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.4.</note>
                  <hi>O that I was made Judge in the Land.</hi> So saith the carnal man's Soul, O that I had this, and that, without end.</p>
               <p>And since the fall, man's desires do commonly corrupt into lust, as <hi>Amnon</hi>'s did to <hi>Tamar.</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men are taken with the outward appearance of things, as <hi>Samuel</hi> was with <hi>Eliab</hi>'s goodly person,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.</note> and for that he thought him to be the Lord's anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note>
                  <hi>Esau</hi> phansied a mess of Pottage better than the birth-right.</p>
               <p>Well therefore said the Apostle,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.5.</note>
                  <hi>They that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh, savour the things of the flesh; and they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit.</hi> The honours, profits, and pleasures of this world relish, and go down better with the one; and the love and grace of God, interest in Christ, pardon and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of sin with the other. <hi>Many say,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 4.6.</note>
                  <hi>who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 73.25.</note>
                  <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> Take what you will of the world from this man, and if you can give him God in the room, he is well. <hi>The Lord is my portion, saith my Soul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3.24.</note> But if you can take away God from him, and give him what you will, yet he complains; as he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Idols, in <hi>Judges</hi> 18.24. <hi>Ye have taken
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94446:125"/>away my gods; and what is this that ye say unto me What aileth thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This discovers the great difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween meer natural men, and men that have grace. The one looks at present things; <hi>Demas hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.10.</note>
                  <hi>and embraced this present world;</hi> such men are <hi>blind, and see not afar off,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Heaven is a Countrey out of sight to such men;
<note place="margin">Pope Zachary condemn'd Virgilius a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there be Antipodes.</note> and a world to come is as uncouth to them as a world in the Moon, and as the Antipodes are to some. But men who have grace look more at things which are not seen, and eternal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. They see and enjoy Promises that are afar off.
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.13.</note> Grace sees as far as glory. And when the men of this world are full of the things of this world, and they empty; these see, and satisfie themselves with some better things that God hath provided for them.
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.40.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the people of God receive the word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: Take heed that you degenerate not from the nature and temper of Saints; be not like natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men in your fondness of the things of this world. If God find your hearts going to and fro in the earth, as Satan said of himself, or like the hearts of carnal men; he will rebuke you for it some way or other, as he did <hi>Elias,</hi> when he said to him in the Wilderness,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 19.13.</note>
                  <hi>What doest thou here</hi> Elias? Desires after the things of this world you may have, but gaged and bounded, as the waves of the Sea are.</p>
               <p>Take heed your desires corrupt not into lust; and one of your great works, as Christians, is done.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:94446:125"/>
               <p>Indeed, if there should be no desire, a Saints earthly enjoyments would have no sweet in them; where desire fails,
<note place="margin">Eccles. 12.5.</note> the sweet of Creature comfort fails. What is bread to a man that hath no appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite? or drink, if he have not thirst?</p>
               <p>Yet desire to these outward things corrupted into lust, is worse than no desire: So was <hi>Israel</hi>'s lusting after flesh, and <hi>Amnon</hi>'s lusting after <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> and <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s lusting after a reward at such a season as that was wherein he did it. Corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires will corrupt the things desired. Thus they shall be hurtful to you, as <hi>Saul</hi> was to <hi>Israel,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> to <hi>Sampson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man have a distempered thirst, the more he drinks, the more his distemper grows upon him; though he drink much, it satisfies little: the way is to get his preternatural thirst cured, for it cannot be satisfied.</p>
               <p>Thus, the stronger desires are after the things of the world, the less content there is in them. <hi>The eye is not satisfied with seeing;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 2.8. &amp; 5.10.</note> and <hi>he that loveth abundance shall not be satisfied with increase.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore if you feel a thirst in your hearts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the things of this world, get the Distemper heal'd; never expect to have your thirst satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may I cure it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Why, exchange your carnal lustings into spiritual: <hi>Covet earnestly the best things.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note> The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you taste the waters that Christ gives you, that is the grace and comfort of his spirit,
<note place="margin">John 4.14.</note> the less thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty you will be after the things of this world.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:94446:126"/>
               <p>It is one of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s sayings, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.19. <hi>That money answers all things, i. e.</hi> all outward things: and this is as true a saying, That the Spirit answers all things, all good things. Compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. with <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. In the first place our Lord Jesus saith — <hi>how much more shall your Father in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</hi> In the other, <hi>How much more shall your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Christ makes the holy Spirit to answer all good things. And thus much for the first Doctrine in the sixteenth Verse,
<q>That the things of this world are compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively but Husks or Swines meat, when separated from the enjoyment of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</q>

               <p>THERE is a second Doctrine contained in this first part of the sixteenth Verse. For, whereas it is said, that <hi>he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the Swine did eat,</hi> this shews us, the property of Natural men, when troubled in Conscience for sin, is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> That they would sit down with any base things in the world for ease, rather than go to God for it.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:94446:127"/>
               <p>Something of this was spoken on the fifteenth Verse; I shall not add much.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cain</hi>'s Conscience vexed him, he humbled not himself to God, but quarell'd with him; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.14.</note>
                  <hi>thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth—and every one that findeth me shall slay me.</hi> And when God put him besides this fear, in <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Whosoever slayeth</hi> Cain, <hi>vengeance shall be taken on him;</hi> yet he applied not himself humbly to God, but <hi>went out from the presence of the Lord,</hi> v. 16. And what went he out for? for rest:
<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> He traverst the world for it, as that unclean Spirit did; and he seats himself in the most pleasant place he could find on earth, on the East of <hi>Eden. Eden</hi> was called <hi>The Garden of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.16. Ezek. 28.</note> There <hi>he built a City, and called it after the name of his son</hi> Enoch; and all this to charm his vexed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Thus when the evil Spirit was upon <hi>Saul,</hi> he sought not to God,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.23.</note> but for sweet Musick; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the requisiteness of the pain puts them upon any thing next for present ease. The terrours of God on the Conscience of a sinner, are worse than the sits of the stone, or any other tormenting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease: They are sparkles of hell fire.</p>
               <p>But yet the main Reason, why men in pains of Conscience for sin make any diversions from God for quiet and ease, is, because men naturally are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come to God; they are unacquainted with him,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> being, as it were, <hi>without God in the world.</hi> They know the world better than God. And</p>
               <p>Again, their estrangedness from God makes them afraid of him;
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10.</note> as <hi>Adam</hi> when he had sinned was. As stout as many sinners seem to be for a time;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94446:127"/>yet the time will come, that it will be with such sinners as with the sinners of <hi>Zion, Isa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>The sinners of</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid; who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</hi> Kings, and great men, and rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, will hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the Mountains, and say to them, <hi>fall on us,</hi>

                  <hi>and hide us</hi>— It is, or shall be with guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as it is with the Devils,

The Elect themselves, if they might have their own way, would be content to remain in a state of Nature with any peace they could get; the practice of this Prodigal, as the Representative of sinners, shews it</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let no man troubled in Conscience for sin, think of getting any peace that will be to any purpose, but what they get from God, and his Word. The grieved Conscience, that has peace any other way, is but as a broken bone ill set, the pains must be repeated in setting again.

               <p>O! it's a much better sign, when the Lord hedges up such a sinners way to false Sanctuaries, as he did theirs <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.6. when God charges all other San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries but himself not to succour such a sad sinner; help him not, ease him not, supply him not, satisfie him not, this is a mercy to a sinner; and a good sign, when the Lord brings a sinners thoughts of relief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so narrow a compass, as to seek it in himself, and no where else; and makes all other Refuges say to him, as the King of <hi>Israel</hi> did to the woman that cried to him for help in a time of famine;
<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.</note>
                  <hi>How should I help thee, if God help thee not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God will save a sinner, he will trouble his Conscience, and let it sting, and the wound bleed, till he indeed draw in his eyes and thoughts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by Christ. When a man places a Net in the water to catch fish, or on the land to get fowl, he'l
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94446:130"/>stop all hopes of escape: And so will God, when he purposes to save a man; he'l stop all inlets of peace and comfort, but what is from himself.</p>
               <p>It was happy for that diseased woman,
<note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note> that she found no help from any of her Physicians; for by this means she became acquainted with Jesus Christ, and was fully cured by him. God will beat a sinner from every bush, under which he thinks to shelter himself on this side Christ, and Christ as offer'd by the Gospel, when he intends his conversion and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                  <head>Reasons of the Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>If God did not thus by those he means to save his Election would be frustrate, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> and the Scripture would fail,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.7.</note> which saith, <hi>The election hath obtained it.</hi> For the Elect would persist in opposition to their Conversion, as well as other men; there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and others, till their Calling make it. There is a difference in Gods purpose, not in theirs; the Elect are as willing as other men to stay in their natural state.
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> As <hi>Lot</hi> was loth to leave <hi>Sodom,</hi> as well as his sons in law; but God being merciful to him, the Angel brought him forth, that he should not perish in the City.</p>
                  <p>No man by nature hath any desire to a state of grace,
<note place="margin">John 6.44.</note> but the very Elect resist, till <hi>the Father draw them;</hi> as <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> had no mind to go over <hi>Jordan</hi> into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Therefore when the Spirit does his office in convincing such of sin, he lets them not find rest at any Sanctuary on this side God himself.</p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:94446:130"/>
                  <p>If a convinced sinner, a sinner troubled within, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> should meet with any ease and rest in other Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he would love these more than God. If a wounded man find a weed in the field that gives him ease, he'l love that weed more than the best and sweetest flowers in a Garden. Men will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend most the Medicine that helps their distemper, and asswages their pain.</p>
                  <p>So that if God did not make a sinners Refuge bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, as well as his sins, he would love such things better than God. As the <hi>Israelites</hi> straits in the wilderness made them like <hi>Egypt</hi> better than <hi>Canaan,</hi> because of the flesh-pots and onyons, &amp;c. they had there their fill of. And therefore God will break, or empty Cisterns, that men may have more mind to the Spring.</p>
                  <p>When God brings the sinner out of trouble of Conscience, he does it in such a way, as a man may see that he is beholding to God only for quenching the sparks of Hell in his Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Hereby God magnifies his own Free-grace, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> in that after a sinners trial elsewhere for ease to no purpose, he will cure the wound himself. God does not do or say in the like case as men do; as he said in <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Cum nemini obtrudi potest, itur ad me.</hi> I am thy last Refuge; if thou couldest have had peace any where else, thou hadst not come to me.</p>
                  <p>But God is free in the case, that he may thereby honour his Free-grace; as he said of <hi>Ephraim, Isa.</hi> 57.17, 18. <hi>I hid me, and was wrath. Ephraim</hi> has a taste of the wrath of God in his soul; and what then, does he humble himself to God? No; but <hi>he went on frowardly in the way of his heart;</hi> he shirk'd and shifted up and down to get off the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94446:131"/>trouble, but could not: And what then? did God leave him thus? No; <hi>I have seen his ways, and will heal him.</hi> O how greatly does God here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Free-grace to sinners! He useth to say to poor undone sinners as he did to <hi>Israel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 13.9, 10.</note>
                     <hi>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self, but in me is thy help.</hi> There is none other that can save thee.</p>

This informs us, That God hath a secret work on the hearts of sinners, whom he will convert, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their conversion, while they themselves are hindering it. When the sinner labours under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, which God intends shall be to conversion, God keeps him from despair on the one hand, and from presuming on Self-refuges on the other, that he may neither wilfully refuse relief, nor lean upon broken Reeds; that he neither perish on the Rocks or Sands, but flie to God, betake himself to the Lord as the only sufficient Sanctuary:

                  <p n="2">2. This shews, that a man's estate is never the worse liking, when he can settle his Conscience, his unquiet Conscience, with nothing on this side God himself, and his Free-grace in Christ. Art thou troubled in Conscience for sin, and canst find no satisfaction or ease, though thou hast tried twenty ways? why, all this may be; because God intends to do the Cure himself, and make thee to know it; that so when thy Conscience is settled, thou maiest say as the Psalmist said, <hi>This is the Lord's doing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 118.23.</note>
                     <hi>and it is marvellous in mine eyes.</hi> When the man that had an infirmity thirty eight years,
<note place="margin">John 5.</note> could not be healed by the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> because he could not get in of himself, Christ himself healed him.</p>
                  <p>That troubled sinner is in a dangerous condition, whose trouble of Conscience meets with peace on this side the Free-grace of God in Jesus Christ; it's a sign God leaves that man to his deceitful Refuges and Sanctuaries, where he sculks at present from the sense of sin and wrath: As he did by <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when he took up with Idols, <hi>Let him alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 4.17.</note> says God; let him see what will come on't.</p>
                  <p>And on the other hand, if in thy Conscience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouble and distress thou hast been beaten from bush to bush, where thou thoughtest to have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but still hast met with disappointments, live in some hope that God means thee good, that he has in his own thoughts named thee <hi>Ruamah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 2.1.</note>
                     <hi>having obtained mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O let no convinced sinner think himself the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because he hath company to divert his troubled thoughts, or worldly business to take up his thoughts, or the thoughts of some good thing in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94446:132"/>himself to please and stroke himself with, or some good purposes to be better hereafter; alas, these are but charms to get a little ease for present: They do but hinder thy thorow humiliation for sin, and thy sinful state, which is previously needful to thy thorow conversion to God.</p>
                  <p>It were a better sign that all Refuges should fail thee on this side thy looking after God himself for peace with him, and from him.</p>
                  <p>And if God should not do thus with men, they would never get beyond the first step of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their sinful state: For so soon as they have a sense of sin, and are afraid of wrath, they begin to look about them for a hedge, or a house, to get from the storm, in hopes it will be over; therefore God disables their shifts, and beats them from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till from all, that when they find no footing on dry ground, they may, like the Dove, sly to the Ark. God allures sinners, whom he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and save,

                     <hi>We looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, but behold trouble;</hi> now you will fall upon plain dealing with your own souls, and with God, and cast your selves upon mercy and Free-grace: So it follows, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.20. <hi>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, for we have sinned against thee; do not abhor us for thy Name sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been the larger in the Application of this point, because of the errour and mistake of poor souls on both hands: Some in betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to false Refuges in their gripes of Conscience.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94446:132"/>For though there were many Cities of Refuge in the Law, yet there is but one in the Gospel, that is Christ, and the Free-grace of God through him.</p>
                  <p>Others again, disquieted in Conscience by, and for sin, and seek, and can find no rest for their souls under Heaven, they think themselves quite lost, and that they shall perish for ever; whereas it is a better sign to them than they are aware of, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ means to bring them from all other Sanctuaries to himself;

               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:94446:134"/>
               <p>When the Prodigal was in such want, that he would have eaten what men gave to Swine, and none gave unto him, this, to his own apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the very depth of misery, and yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the inlet of mercy: As the <hi>valley of Achor,</hi> or the valley of trouble, was given by God to <hi>Israel for a door of hope.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 2.15.</note> Bare conviction of sin leaves a man as far from God as before, till he be beaten out of all his creeping holes. It's true, the first work of the Spirit in order to Conversion is conviction of sin, that this man is a sinner. I but, saith this man, so are others, so are all men. Therefore the Spirit goes further, and convinces this man that he has no grace, but is in a state of sin. Otherwise, though men be convinced that they are sinners, yet they think they have some grace; and so their opinion of grace keeps out grace. It's a step towards a state of grace, for a man to be thorowly convinced that he has no grace.</p>
               <p>A man is never the poorer for casting away coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit grace; that which he thought to be grace, but is not.

                  <p>Labour than for a double conviction in order to Conversion; a conviction of sin, and a conviction of the vanity of all Sanctuaries but God himself, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom men have sinned. Sight and sense of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94446:134"/>sin and wrath, will send men to a Citizen of a far Countrey, to something of this World for relief; but experience of the unprofitableness of this way sends them to their Father's house, where is help in deed.</p>
                  <p>The more a man is emptied of himself, and the Creature, the nearer he is to God. It is darkest a little afore day break. When a convinced sinner is at worst for relief in his own thoughts, he is fair for it.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But are there not some sinners troubled in Conscience by sin, that find no releif in the World, and yet look not after it in God; as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and the men that were scorched with great heat,
<note place="margin">Rev. 16.9.</note> and yet blasphemed God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no preparative to a sinner's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version that works further in a sinner than God leads it on: Converts are <hi>born of the will of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.13.</note> and not their own. The Plow is not the cause of the earths bearing fruit, but the Seed that is cast into it: though there be plowing and harrowing, and the first and latter rain; yet there can be no fruit, if there be no seed.</p>
                  <p>It's true, that God ordinarily brings about a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Conversion by preparatives; which although we should say they work Physically, yet can they go no further than their own nature, as preparatives, and so can never finish the work.</p>
                  <p>It was not the water of <hi>Jordan</hi> that cured <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s leprosie so much as the will of God put forth in it, and the word of God that commanded it.
<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.</note> Though the wax be melted, yet it's the owners hand that sets on the Seal, and makes the impression. A man may be convinced of his sinful state, and helpless
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94446:135"/>state, and yet not be converted, except the will and power of God work-up conviction so far. It was not the whirl-wind,
<note place="margin">Job 38.2.</note> but the powerful voice of God in it, that humbled <hi>Job</hi> to silence and self-abhorrence. And therefore men should give God the glory of the effectual working of all their preparatives to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
<note place="margin">Psal. 115.1.</note>
                     <hi>Not unto us, Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the glory, for thy mercy and for thy truths sake.</hi> When God hath a will to save a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he puts powerful and effectual influences into the preparatives of his Conversion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But then a convinced and conscience-afflicted sinner is still at an uncertainty for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; when beaten off of all his Refuges, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version still depends on God's will and power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer that such a man is not at that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty as before: For first, he is at a certainty for God's power, that that cannot fail him, though all his other helps have fail'd. And secondly, if the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scales hang upon God's will, his solemn invitations and promises may incourage him as to the will of God in the case;
<note place="margin">Ezek.</note> — <hi>why will ye die, O ye house of Israel?</hi> It's mens own wills, and not God's, that damns them. Though there may be ground of a sinner's despair in himself, yet there is none in God. God hath so set forth himself to a sinner, both as to his power and will, as to leave no cause of despair. God hates and abhors the despair of a sinner more than all his other sins.</p>
                  <p>The Devil cannot revenge himself more on God, than to bring reproach on him by a sinner's despair; for herein the Devil makes the sinner likest to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: He is himself a desperate sinner, and he would have other sinners to be so. This is one of the chiefest
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94446:135"/>sins that Satan aims at in his temptations to sin; his tempting to other sins is to dispose men to this; as wooll hath first a tincture of a lighter colour, that it may receive a deeper die.</p>
                  <p>And let convinced and self-judged sinners consider, that despair puts them actually under the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Hell in part, when as other sins only bind them over to condemnation; even the greatest of Gospel sins, which is unbelief:
<note place="margin">John 16.9. Mark 16.16. John 3.18.</note>
                     <hi>He shall convince the world of sin, because they believe not in me; and he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> He is condemned already, Sentence is passed upon him, but it is not executed; but in a sinner's despair, execution is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
                  <p>O then let not sinners in trouble of Conscience for sin consult with reason disorder'd and mated by temptation in the case: This reason is low of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and cannot see mercy and free grace in the throng and press of his sins; but stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Promise, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did on the Tree, on that Promise in <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. or of the like nature, he will be in sight of hope.</p>
                  <p>A man may have mighty sins, but not almighty;
<note place="margin">Amos 5.12.</note> but the mercy of God is almighty mercy. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God is unlimited to those that do not limit it; that is, who seek for cleansing and purging mercy, as well as pardoning. And therefore for sinners that would be penitent, as well as pardoned sinners, for such to say in their hearts, <hi>Can God forgive my sins?</hi> is as great a sin, as it was to <hi>Israel</hi> to say in their straits, <hi>Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Remember and consider what the Lord saith in this case, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 55.7.</note> he can pardon abundantly.</p>

                  <p>The very holiness of God inclines him to mercy, as man's wickedness inclines him to cruelty: <hi>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 12.10.</note> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who is the greatest of sinners, is disposed to the greatest revenge and cruelty: he would revenge himself on God if he could; and therefore he belies God to man, as well as he does man to God: As he charged <hi>Job</hi> with hypocrisie to God, so he charged God with cruelty to <hi>Job.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 2.9.</note>
                     <hi>Doest thou still retain thy integrity? Curse God and die.</hi> There is no such thing in the Devil, as the least pity towards any sinner. But God's holiness disposes him to pity poor sinners, when their Souls are in trouble for sin. <hi>Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whose Name is holy; I dwell in the high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 57.15.</note>
                     <hi>with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The holy God can be righteous in pardoning sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<note place="margin">1 John 1.9.</note> as well as in damning them for sin; <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our sins, he is just and faithful to forgive us our sins</hi>— Oh therefore, if there be any one that the Spirit of God hath convinced of their dangerous and damnable state in sin, and set their Consciences on the rack by the spirit of bondage, and withal beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them from all false refuge, let such come to God, and try him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But is it likely that God will harbour such a wretched sinner as I, who make him my last refuge, when all others have failed me, and now I come to him on meer necessity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, meer necessity may turn a sinner's eye to God at first.
<note place="margin">Luke 14.23.</note> At first God <hi>compells men to come into the feast.</hi> Sinners are constrain'd upon necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94446:136"/>to betake themselves to God for sanctuary. God allows men to come to him out of self-love at first, though after love to God must keep them with him. It's well that mens sense of their own misery will force them to seek after mercy in God. The Father will suffer those things in a child, which he will not do after.
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.39, 41.</note> The <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed Jesus at first for the womans words; but after because of his own word.</p>
                  <p>That woman which had a bloody Issue was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Christ for healing on necessity,
<note place="margin">Matth. 9.20.</note> for she had spent all on the Physician, and to no purpose; and when all would do nothing, she applied her self to Jesus Christ for cure, and he heals her; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to his honour, that he could do, and had done that which no other means could do.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is good for poor sinners in their Soul-straits to look at the power and freeness of God's grace, which can and will help them, when other refuges have fail'd them, that they may magnifie God's grace above all.</p>
                  <p>God's time of giving grace, is when he may have the honour of it:
<note place="margin">James 4.6.</note> Therefore <hi>he gives grace to the humble,</hi> because he knows the humble will give him the glory of his grace.</p>
                  <p>But then, though a sinner may go to God of pure necessity, and self-love at first; yet when he is come to God,
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.28.</note> he must and will abide with God in love to God himself; he will now say, <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now let the presuming sinner live in sin, and the convinced troubled sinner despair of mercy from God, at their own eternal peril. For the first,
<note place="margin">Deut. 29.19, 20.</note> God will assuredly curse that sinner, who blesseth himself in his sins.</p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:94446:137"/>
                  <p>And for the convinced and conscience-pricked sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who hath mercy offered him by the Gospel, and yet despairs of mercy from God by Christ, it argues a defect in that sinners humiliation for sin: For it is not so much the greatness of sin, as the greatness of the sinners spirit, that is the cause of his despair. To those Jews who said,
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>5. Ezck. 33.10.</note>
                     <hi>There is no hope, we shall pine away in our sins,</hi> God hath said, <hi>Your words have been stout against me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3.13, 14.</note> Wherein say they: <hi>Ye have said, It is in vain to serve God, and so to seek him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may not doubt to say, that there was never any sinner outed of his sins and himself, who missed of mercy, if he sought it of God. Thus much for the sixteenth verse, with which endeth the first part of the Parable.</p>
